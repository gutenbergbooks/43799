<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The urgent need for practical information on the
important subject of Gunnery is evinced by the
numerous patents taken out during the last few
years, most of which have fallen still-born, through
deficient practical science on the part of the inventors.
My aim in producing this book has been to point out
the errors into which many ingenious inventors have
fallen, and to show how similar failures may be
avoided in future, by indicating the only right road
to improvement in Gunnery,&mdash;the strict observance
of scientific principles in every old process and in
all new inventions: for it is to the ignorance or
neglect of the principles of the science that failures
in Gunnery are due.</p>

<p>The necessity for progress in the science of Gunnery
is now rendered more than ever imperative on
our Government by the prodigious energy and
activity of foreign Governments in providing armaments
for land and sea service, the efficiency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
which is ensured by adopting all the newest improvements
in fire-arms. But the obstinate reluctance
which all our previous Governments have
shown to enter upon the, to them unwelcome, duty
of investigating and experimenting on warlike inventions,
necessitates strong &#8220;pressure from without;&#8221;
for it may be truly said that all great
improvements in Gunnery in England have been
forced upon the authorities by absolute necessity,
and it is still a question whether we shall profit by
our recent experiences, or, as before, allow war to
find us unprepared. We have, doubtless, armaments
of gigantic proportions, and mammoth vessels of
war, capable of discharging an ordinary ship&#8217;s cargo
of shot and shell at a broadside; yet while millions
have been thus expended, the <em class="ital">improvement of the
Gun</em>, without which they would be mere masses of
wood, and targets for more skilful opponents, has
been neglected.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">GUN</span> and its <span class="smcapall">PROJECTILE</span> will decide the victory
in future fights. Indeed, we are even now waging war
with our neighbours,&mdash;not on the battle-field or the
ocean wave, but in the foundry; engineers being our
generals, and founders our admirals. The present
able ruler of France is actively at work, while
we are but looking on: he is casting cannon the
like of which have never been seen, while we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
spending thousands in experimenting on cast-iron and
foundries; and by the time our officials have discovered
the best cast-iron for heavy guns, the French
batteries on sea and land will be bristling with
<span class="smcap">Rifled Steel Cannon</span> of tremendous range and
endless endurance.</p>

<p>Woe betide this country if at the commencement
of a war we should find ourselves just where we are.</p>

<p>The Emperor Napoleon, as is well known, is well
versed, theoretically and practically, in everything
relating to Gunnery. Keenly alive to the minutest
points of progress he receives, investigates, and immediately
adopts all inventions of value; having
the ability to perceive, the sagacity to appreciate, and
the liberality to reward merit wherever it is shown.</p>

<p>Compare his system with ours, where men are
placed in official positions, and entrusted with power,
not because of their ability to fulfil the duties of
their office, but for very inferior and often unworthy
reasons; where talent and fitness are not considered,
and consequently a long routine of forms is made to
serve as &#8220;a buffer&#8221; to resist the troublesome pertinacity
of inventors, who are apt to disturb the serenity
of reluctant or indifferent officials. And when at
last a trial is granted, the invention is either rejected
or approved by incompetent or prejudiced judges.
While this practice prevails, England must ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
be behindhand in Gunnery; for improvements in
cannon and projectiles cannot be carried out by
private enterprise.</p>

<p>In thus strongly expressing my opinion of the way
in which progress is balked, I am not merely echoing
a cry, but speaking from my own knowledge and
experience. I am actuated by no feeling of disappointment,
for my invention of &#8220;the expansive bullet&#8221; has
been at last adopted here, after it had been copied in
France. My object is to induce public investigation
and inquiry, and to ventilate this important subject;
and I trust that my antecedents, and the fulfilment
of my predictions in matters of Gunnery, will give
weight to this deliberate and disinterested expression
of opinion.</p>

<p>The great favour shown by lovers of shooting to
my former efforts to disseminate a better understanding
of the principles of Gunnery, has been an
additional stimulus to the production of the present
work; and I have taken especial care that my
observations should tend to the improvement of sporting
arms, and the increased safety of the sportsman.</p>

<p>Nor has the ingenious mechanic been overlooked,
for perfection of gun-manufacture must ever go hand
in hand with scientific principle; and the desire to
promote their combination has prompted my endeavours
to elucidate the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving to the reader to determine how far I have
succeeded in my efforts, I merely wish to add that I
make no pretension to literary style, but have aimed
to produce a practical work for practical men. I
have drawn upon my previous works for such portions
of information as were needful to give completeness
to this view of the science of Gunnery, its present
state, and probable future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chapname">ANCIENT ARMS.</span></h2>

<p>From the earliest ages of the world, the jealousies
and bickerings of mankind have been fruitful causes
of war. Sometimes, perhaps, justified by political
reasons; at others, it may be, arising solely from a
desire, on the part of ambitious chiefs, to extend their
territories by multiplying their conquests; while, in
too many cases, the struggle for religious ascendancy
has led to the most sanguinary and cruel battles.</p>

<p>War has been considered as a science from the
most remote ages, and the ingenuity of the talented
has successively been taxed to render it as perfect as
possible. It is true<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Man&#8217;s earliest arms were fingers, teeth, and nails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stones and fragments from the branching woods;&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but these soon gave place to others, more calculated
to decide unequal, and often protracted, conflicts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Arms, in a general sense, include all kinds of
weapons, both offensive and defensive; and amongst
the earliest may be classed the bow and arrow, as it
gave facilities to man to capture the wild animals for
food, probably before their use was required for the
purposes of war. The bow and the sling were the
first means invented, and next only to the human arm
for projecting bodies with an offensive aim: the great
principle which, to the present day, reigns unrivalled,
developing the ruling passion of man to injure, while
remaining himself in comparative safety,&mdash;&#8220;self-preservation&#8221;
being &#8220;the first law of nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the bow and sling were soon added spears,
swords, axes, and javelins, all of which appear to have
been used by the Jews. David destroyed Goliath
with a stone from the brook. The invention of the
sling is attributed, by ancient writers, to the Ph&#339;nicians,
or the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands.
The great fame that these islanders obtained arose
from their assiduity in its use; their children were
not allowed to eat until they struck their food from the
top of a pole with a stone from a sling. From the
accounts left us (probably fabulous), it appears that
the immense force with which a stone could be projected,
can only be exceeded by modern gunnery.
Even at that early age, leaden balls were in use as
projectiles; though we cannot put much faith in
Seneca&#8217;s account of the velocity being so great as
frequently to melt the lead. The use of the sling
continued over a long period of time, even as late
as the Huguenot war in 1572.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The bow is of equal, if not greater, antiquity.
The first account we find of it is in Genesis, 21st
chapter and 20th verse, where the Lawgiver, speaking
of Ishmael, says, &#8220;And God was with the lad, and
he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became
an archer.&#8221; The arms of the ancient Greeks and
Persians were such as we have described, with the
addition of chariots armed with scythes, in which the
chiefs sometimes fought; though their main dependence
was upon their heavy-armed infantry. Elephants
were afterwards used as adjuncts in their military
operations, but their use does not appear to have
been very great or very permanent.</p>

<p>The Romans were armed much in the same manner
as the Greeks, with a slight difference in the form of
their weapons; and the arms of the early Saxons
were similar; those of the Normans were only altered
in their construction, except that to them appears to
be awarded the invention of the <em class="ital">cross-bow</em>, an instrument
which afterwards became of great repute in
England and elsewhere. It has also been asserted,
that the Normans were the first to introduce a species
of field artillery, from which stones and darts were
thrown, and arrows, headed with combustible matter,
for firing towns and shipping.</p>

<p>The artillery-proper of the ancients, as the engines
for projecting masses of stone and such like materials
may be termed, reached to wonderful perfection;
and the velocity with which missiles of every description
could be thrown from them, attest the skill and
ingenuity exercised in their construction: indeed it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
quite evident they are only excelled by the <em class="ital">more
portable</em>, and simply constructed, artillery of our own
day.</p>

<p>The great artillerist of the Sicilians, Archimedes,
seems to have made some of the most powerful
engines; but he, considering any attention to mechanics
as beneath the philosopher, has not left us
an account of any one of them.</p>

<p>It is said of the cross-bow that a <i>quarrel</i> could
be projected from them 200 yards, so that we may
imagine the force with which one of these lumps of
iron would strike even the strongest armour,&mdash;as the
velocity, to range that distance, would not be far
short of 900 or 1,000 feet per second; nearly equal
to the effect of a ball from one of our old imperfectly
constructed muskets.</p>

<p>We are told incredible stories of the abilities of
some of our bygone archers. Should it be true, as
stated, that an arrow could be shot nearly 700 yards,
we can easily conceive the immense velocity with
which it must have left the bow; this range being
quite equal, if not superior, to that of the late unimproved
rifles. Though we must bear in mind, that
the peculiar shape of the arrow fits it to cut the
atmosphere with less resistance then the half sphere
of a bullet; and hence one reason of its obtaining an
extensive range. There is a story told of the famous
Robin Hood, and Little John, &#8220;who could shoot an
arrow a measured mile.&#8221; We suppose the mile was
the reverse of an Irish one, or they had the advantage
of a precious stiff gale of wind. Historians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sometimes &#8220;draw the long-bow&#8221; as well as archers.
Many statements have descended to us of the power of
the battering rams of old; but we have a much more
ready method of blowing open gates by a single bag
of gunpowder; and a 68 lb. shot has all the force that
could be given even to that famous ram of Vespasian,
&#8220;the length whereof was only fifty cubits, which
came not up to the size of many of the Grecian
rams, had a head as thick as ten men, and twenty-five
horns, each of which was as thick as one man,
and placed a cubit distance from the rest; the
weight, as was customary, rested on the hinder part,
and was no less than 1,500 talents; when it was
removed, without being taken to pieces, 150 yoke of
oxen, or 300 pairs of horses and mules, laboured in
drawing it, and 1,500 men employed their utmost
strength in forcing it against the walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these remarks we shall proceed to introduce
the invention of Gunnery.</p>

<p>Barbour, in his life of Bruce, informs us that guns
were first employed by the English at the battle of
Werewater, which was fought in 1327, about forty
years after the death of Friar Bacon; and there is no
doubt that four guns were used at the battle of Cressy,
fought in 1346, when they were supposed to have been
quite unknown to the French, and tended to obtain for
British arms the victory. Froissart gives an excellent
representation of a cannon and cannoneers, in 1390, a
<a href="#Fig1">cut of which</a> we give in the following page.</p>

<p>The use of guns in warfare is, therefore, comparatively
of modern date, and the early specimens which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
are still extant, of which we have drawings and descriptions,
must have been of very little service compared
with those of the present day. The English
musqueteer was formerly a most encumbered soldier.
&#8220;He had, besides the unwieldy weapon itself, his
coarse powder for loading in a flask, his fine powder
for priming in a touch-box, his bullets in a leathern
bag, with strings to draw to get at them, whilst in his
hand were his musket-rest and his burning match;
and when he had discharged his piece, he had to
draw his sword in order to defend himself. Hence
it became a question, and was so for a long time,
whether the bow did not deserve a preference over
the musket.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The mention of the <em class="ital">long-bow</em> is frequent in English
history, and its use contributed, in no mean degree,
to many important victories. Perhaps it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that our forefathers were more skilful in the use of
their weapons than their adversaries.</p>

<p>In our wars in France, in the reign of Edward III.,
thousands suffered by the English archery; and the
brilliant success which attended them was, at that
time, attributed to their &#8220;superior skill, combined
with the valour of the Black Prince.&#8221; So highly was
this practice esteemed, that many statutes were enacted
in successive reigns to encourage or enforce it.</p>

<p>Archery furnished matter for oratorical display, both
in the senate and the pulpit; the palace and the
cottage alike bore testimony to the great importance
which was attached to the art; and it was at once the
study and pastime of the whole nation. Thus, long
after the introduction of fire-arms, the long-bow was
held in great esteem; and it is no wonder that this
favourite instrument should have been reluctantly relinquished,
after obtaining such universal popularity,
and becoming so intimately connected with many
national and important events. It is now superseded
by the gun, a more potent and destructive engine.
The bow, so much valued, has vanished from our
ranks by slow gradations, to make way for the musket;
and the quivers of cloth-yard shafts have been supplanted
by bristling bayonets. These things are now
practically unknown as military weapons, though they
contended for superiority with fire-arms during two
centuries.</p>

<p>At this period, and for a long time previously,
more attention was paid to the fabrication of defensive
armour, than to the invention of weapons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
an offensive character; hence the perfection that was
attained in the manufacture of mail, of every variety,
during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The
splendid manner in which some of the chivalrous
knights of that age chose to have their armour constructed
and ornamented sometimes proved fatal to
themselves. Froissart relates that Raymond, nephew
to Pope Clement, was taken prisoner, and put to
death by his captors, in order that they might become
possessed of his magnificent armour. Those gorgeous
and costly fabrications were likewise doomed to give
place to the advancing knowledge and skill of succeeding
generations; being now only known as matters
of history, and regarded as valuable curiosities. So
late, however, as the latter part of the sixteenth
century, armour formed part of the military equipment;
and the French cavalry, called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carabins</i>, are
described as having the cuirass sloped off the right
shoulder, that they might the more readily couch
their cheeks to take aim, while their bridle arms
were protected by an elbow gauntlet.</p>

<p>The invention of portable fire-arms is awarded to
the Italians by Sir Samuel Meyrick, and, in a memoir
in the Arch&aelig;ologia of the Society of Antiquarians, he
has named the year 1430 as the precise period of
their introduction.</p>

<p>We have already stated that cannon, or heavy
ordnance, was in use in the English army in 1327,
more than a century before that time. It is not
improbable, however, that the Italians were the
originators of small fire-arms, for they had for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
years been celebrated as skilful in the art of making
armour&mdash;Milanese armour being considered the most
valuable, and it is natural that their attention should
be directed to the construction of offensive weapons
of a different description.</p>

<p>The invention of the portable fire-arm, in its
primitive state, was one of extreme simplicity; the
gun consisting merely of a tube fixed to a straight
stock of wood, about three feet in length, furnished
with trunnions, cascable, and touch-hole: the latter
was, in the first instance, at the top, like a large cannon,
but was afterwards altered to the side where a
small pan was placed to hold the priming, and lessen
the liability of its being blown away by the wind.
This contrivance was the first step to the gun-lock.</p>

<p>Before the adoption of the match-lock by the
English, cannon, as I have before shown, had been
in use, though they were of a clumsy description.</p>

</div>

<p>To the indefatigable exertions of Mr. Dean, we
are indebted for the recovery of several brass and
iron guns, belonging to the &#8220;Mary Rose,&#8221;&mdash;a vessel
of war, wrecked in the reign of Henry VIII. of
England, and Francis I. of France, in 1545: &#8220;while
standing along the coast, during a distant firing from
the French fleet, under Admiral Annebout, she was
overpowered by the weight of her ordnance, and sunk,
together with her commander and crew of 600 men.&#8221;
One of these iron guns is in an excellent state of
preservation, considering it to have been immersed
above 300 years. The <a href="#Fig2">cut</a> on next page will convey,
together with the following description, a faint idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of its unwieldy and inefficient construction. It is composed
of a tube of iron, whose joint or overlap is as
its length; upon this is a succession of iron hoops,
composed of iron three inches square, being in fact
immense rings; these appear to have been driven on
while red hot, and thus, by their contraction, forming
a much stronger gun, when combined with the interior
tube, than the generality of accounts given of ancient
guns would lead us to expect. It will be perceived,
that to describe it as &#8220;composed of iron bars hooped
together,&#8221; is not correct. We may also mention, that if
parties describing guns of this primitive manufacture
will observe accurately, they will find that this is the
general method by which they have been fabricated.
They all appear to have been loaded by removing a
breech part, or chamber, inserting the charge, replacing
the chamber, and securing it by wedging it behind;
as will be seen on a close inspection. No means of
raising or depressing the muzzle appear available;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the barrel or gun being sunk in a large block of
timber, and secured there by bolts, as a musket
barrel is secured in its stock; while a large piece of
iron, or wood, was inserted perpendicularly into the
deck to prevent the recoil. The advantage of &#8220;chambers&#8221;
was perfectly understood even at this early
period; they were apparently slightly conical, with a
spherical bottom. It is no mean evidence of ancient
skill, and knowledge of gunnery and mechanics combined,
to state, that only a few years ago, a gunmaker
of some celebrity, constructed a number of rifles and
pistols to load at the breech, on the very same
principle adopted in this gun 312 years ago. Strange,
evidence from &#8220;the vasty deep&#8221; to show &#8220;there is
nothing new under the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century, fire-arms of every
description then in use underwent a variety of alterations
and improvements; each change bringing with
it a change of name, which would neither be profitable
or interesting to enumerate here; our object being to
trace out the advances which have been made in the
manufacture of fire-arms since their general adoption
as weapons of war, or auxiliaries to the sports of the
field.</p>

<p>When first introduced into England, the hand-gun,
as it was termed, had already received a slight
improvement, in having a covering for the pan which
contained the priming, and a sight on the breech, to
assist in giving greater certainty to the aim; it
remained thus until the trigger of the cross-bow
suggested a contrivance to convey, with equal certainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and greater rapidity, the burning match to
the pan.</p>

<p>The difficulty of using an instrument thus objectionably
constructed, was in some degree obviated
by the Germans; who, together with the Italians,
were no doubt at this early period the principal
manufacturers; they effected this, to a certain degree,
by giving the stocks a crooked form, so that the
breech could, with more ease, be brought to the level
of the eye; this was, however, only an alteration of
form, without involving any principle or leading
feature of mechanical invention. Succeeding the
match-lock, in the progress of improvement, came the
&#8220;pyrites wheel-lock,&#8221; an invention then looked upon
as exceedingly curious and ingenious; this also is
ascribed to the Italians, and one of the first occasions
of its being used, is said to have been when Pope
Leo X. and the Emperor Charles V. confederated
against France. Whether the Italians are fairly
entitled to the merit of this invention is, however, a
matter of doubt, as it is well known that wheel-locks
were for a long period manufactured in Germany.</p>

<p>The &#8220;<em class="ital">snaphaunce</em>&#8221; or fire-lock, is distinctly stated
by Grose to be of Dutch origin,&mdash;hence the name. It
was introduced into England in the reign of Charles II.,
though its general adoption is stated not to have
taken place until the reign of William III., about
1692. Since that period, until the present, their use
has been general in all the armies of Europe. How
strange it seems that the Chinese and other Asiatics
should have only the match-lock to the present day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
while there can be no question that they used gunpowder
some centuries before its introduction into our
portion of the habitable globe!</p>

<p>The Syrians were formerly celebrated for their skill
in the working of iron. Damascus gun-barrels were not
to be obtained, at certain periods, at a price less than
their weight in silver. The elaborate mixtures in
their barrels, swords, and other weapons, entitle them
justly to the honour of being the best of iron workers,
as we shall hereafter have occasion to show; and the
splendour displayed in their inlaying attests their taste
and ability: but as mechanicians, formers of complex
machinery, they never reached mediocrity. Turkey
and Greece, as well as other countries which were
renowned as having been, in days of yore, nurseries
of the arts, but which have, in later times, degenerated
into a condition little better than semi-barbarous, were
remarkable for the great labour and pains which they
bestowed upon the exterior ornaments of their firearms;
but they never succeeded in improving the
machinery of the lock in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>Although it was not until the latter part of the
seventeenth, or the beginning of the eighteenth
century, that gun manufactories were established in
this kingdom, yet we have attained to a degree of
perfection and excellence unequalled by any other
nation in the world. Birmingham is the emporium
of the world for guns, from the most inferior&mdash;the
&#8220;<em class="ital">park paling</em>,&#8221; so called, of the slave-trade, with
which ships might yet be freighted at the cost
of eight shillings and sixpence each&mdash;up to the
elaborately-finished gun of the peer. Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
alterations which have been made in gun-locks in
England, have been with a view to simplify the
machinery, and obtain the greatest quickness in firing:
much complication has been discarded; a thorough
conviction having seated itself in the minds of
Englishmen, that to attain perfection, simplicity must
be combined.</p>

<p>Many splendid emanations of genius are left to us,
consisting of complex mechanism for gunnery. The
most perfect we have ever seen, is a pistol made in
Spain about the end of the seventeenth century.
By moving a lever towards the butt-end, while the
muzzle is depressed, the lock is primed, half-cocked,
and the hammer shut down; return the lever, the
powder is in the breech, and the ball before it. We
have seen it fire twenty-six shots without a failure,
and with one supply of ammunition. The magazine
was in two tubes in the stock. The chance of
blowing up was thought remote; but it eventually
blew up. In short, it would be strictly advantageous
to inventors in gunnery, to be sure that there has
been no previous invention combining their principle
as well as their arrangements.</p>

<p>The mine of complex inventions was exhausted
during the last century; and the greatest benefactor
to the science of gunnery will be he, who, blowing
away the cobwebs of mystery, renders its principles as
clear as the silvered glass. Nothing now remains
of the beautiful machinery of the flint lock; the
fancy cock and hammers have given place to a
&#8220;simple&#8221; hammer, striking on a copper thimble,
covering a steel pivot. What would the old lock-filers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
say to this, if they could return and see
their handiwork consigned to the scrap-box as old
iron?</p>

<p>To those curious in the progress of invention as it
relates to gunnery, it would be highly interesting to visit
the &#8220;Mus&eacute;e d&#8217;Artillerie&#8221; of Paris, and there to study
the classified selections in the possession of the French
Government. Among other specimens equally interesting,
he will find revolving pistols, revolving rifles, and
swords and revolving pistols combined in one; and these
produced in the early part of the seventeenth century.
The revolving pistol did not therefore originate
with the present generation; and however universally
we may use the &#8220;Colt,&#8221; &#8220;Adams,&#8221; or &#8220;Tranter,&#8221;
neither can lay the slightest claim to originality. In
that museum will be found four, five, and six charge
chambers; and though in all there is certainly an
absence of movement in the chamber, produced by the
cocking of the lock, yet several present the appearance
of having formerly had some mechanical adjunct for
revolving the chamber: this, though well adapted
to the present percussion system, must certainly have
been troublesome to manage in the old flint lock; for
when the first barrel was discharged, the priming of
the other barrels would be lost during the revolution
of the chamber.</p>

<p>A great improvement was, however, soon introduced;
a hammer and pan were attached to each division of
the chamber, and each being already primed, presented
itself in rotation in the face of the flint. The gun
or pistol was by these protuberances rendered clumsy
and cumbersome, and thus fell, no doubt, into disuse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but every real mechanic must see on investigating the
subject, that the principle was as perfect as that
which is now in use. Mr. Colt had considerable
difficulty in securing a patent for his revolver. The
right of patent hinged on this simple question: did he,
or did he not, first introduce a crank or lever for
revolving the chambers during the cocking of the
lock? After an expensive trial it was decided that
he <em class="ital">did</em> introduce it; though doubts are still entertained
whether there is not now extant a pistol having the
same crank movement as that found in the &#8220;Colt&#8221;
and other revolvers. At all events the invention of
revolving pistols originated with our progenitors, more
than 200 years ago, though their re-introduction is
unquestionably due to Mr. Colt; and the &#8220;old broth
warmed up&#8221; has no doubt proved more nutritious than
the original concoction. In the Paris museum, a
number of breech-loading guns are to be seen; I think
more than sixty varieties. Many of them are highly
ingenious, displaying great mechanical knowledge and
working skill, and the whole, kept in splendid order,
cannot fail to command attention.</p>

<p>Well had it been if the many hundred inventors
in England and elsewhere had studied, and made
themselves intimately acquainted with the productions
there to be seen in such abundance. Monuments
they are of mis-spent skill and labour; samples of
the almost hopeless task of fabricating complicated
machinery which shall resist the action of explosive
gases at high pressure. An experiment extending
over two hundred years, but unattended with success,
notwithstanding all the skill and ingenuity brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
bear upon it, is, we think, sufficient to prove that
breech-loading guns cannot be made sufficiently
durable to yield any reasonable return for the extra
expense and trouble attending their fabrication.
Nevertheless, our &#8220;would-be mechanics hope against
hope;&#8221; and to such we would, in conclusion, tender a
word of advice. Before spending your money, make
acquaintance (and an intimate one is necessary) with
all that has been done before, and if in your own
production you find principles which have been untouched
by any previous invention, and untainted by
any of the previous causes of failure, then patent your
invention, and make a fortune&mdash;if you can.</p>

<p>Great mechanical skill, and even scientific principles,
are to be found in some of the earliest productions
after the invention of fire-arms; and thus is
established the important fact, that want of experience
was the chief drawback under which they laboured:
one elaborate machine being unequal to their requirements
was succeeded by another; and yet, with all
these examples patent to us, we still fruitlessly fall
back on exhausted principles.</p>

<p>A more intimate knowledge of what our predecessors
have accomplished would be a great boon to
our race. Foreign nations, but especially France,
have provided for this by their museums; and we want
here a museum of progression, an epitome of the
mind of the present age, and which, continued to
future generations, would leave to no man the
fruitless toil of hauling in an endless rope.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chapname">ON GUNPOWDER.</span></h2>

<p>Gunpowder being the base on which the superstructure
of this treatise is to be raised, the history,
the use, and the nature of this explosive compound,
are here placed in the foreground; as it is essential
to the correct conception of the various matters hereafter
to be explained, that the reader be first
acquainted with the one grand principle in fire-arms,
the propellant power of explosion.</p>

<p>Gunpowder, whether considered relatively to engines
of war, or to those arms used with so much
success in the sporting field, has, since its first
<em class="ital">introduction</em>, been a source of much and frequent
discussion. In regard to its origin, we shall not
much enlarge, nor repeat the many suppositions and
conjectures promulgated by the searchers after antiquarian
evidence.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of India were unquestionably
acquainted with its composition at an early date.
Alexander is supposed to have avoided attacking the
Oxydracea, a people dwelling between the Hyphasis
and Ganges, from a report of their being possessed of
supernatural means of defence: &#8220;For,&#8221; it is said,
&#8220;they come not out to fight those who attack them,
but those holy men, beloved by the gods, overthrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
their enemies with tempests and thunderbolts shot
from their walls;&#8221; and, when the Egyptian Hercules
and Bacchus overran India, they attacked
these people, &#8220;but were repulsed with storms of
thunderbolts and lightning hurled from above.&#8221; This
is, no doubt, evidence of the use of gunpowder; but
as it is unprofitable to investigate this subject further,
we shall merely confine ourselves to the European
authorities.</p>

<p>Many ascribe the discovery of gunpowder to Roger
Bacon, the monk, who was born at Ilchester, in Somersetshire,
in the year 1214, and is said to have died in
1285. No doubt he was by far the most illustrious,
the best informed, and the most philosophical of all
the alchemists. In the 6th chapter of his Epistles of
the Secrets of Arts, the following passage occurs&mdash;&#8220;For
sounds like thunder, and flashes like lightning,
may be made in the air, and they may be rendered
even more horrible than those of nature herself. A
small quantity of matter, properly manufactured, and
not larger than the human thumb, may be made to
produce a horrible noise; and this may be done many
ways, by which a <em class="ital">city</em> or an <em class="ital">army</em> may be destroyed,
as was the case when Gideon and his men broke
their <em class="ital">pitchers</em> and exhibited their lamps, fire issuing
out of them with great force and noise, destroying
an infinite number of the army of the <i>Midianites</i>.&#8221;
And in the 11th chapter of the same epistle occurs
the following passage:&mdash;&#8220;Mix together saltpetre with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">luru mone cap ubre</i>, and sulphur, and you will make
thunder and lightning, if you know the method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mixing them.&#8221; Here all the ingredients of gunpowder
are mentioned, except charcoal; which is,
doubtless, concealed under the barbarous terms used;
indeed, the <em class="ital">anagram</em> is easily converted into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carbonum
pulvere</i>, with a little attention.</p>

<p>This discovery has also been attributed to Schwartz,
a German monk, and the date of 1320 annexed to it;
a date posterior to that which may be justly claimed
for Friar Bacon; and as accident is stated to have
been the means by which he discovered it, we have
taken that incident as the subject of an <a href="#Fig2a">illustration</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig2a" id="Fig2a"></a>
<img src="images/illo037.jpg" alt="Invention of gunpowder" width="550" height="329" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Hallam, referring to the authority of an Arabic
author, infers that there is no question that the
knowledge of gunpowder was introduced into Europe
through the means of the Saracens, before the middle
of the 13th century; and no doubt its use then was
more for fireworks, than as an artillerist projectile
force. There is good evidence, too, that the use of
gunpowder was introduced into Spain by the Moors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
at least as early as the year 1343. Now, as Roger
Bacon is known to have been an Arabic scholar, it is
not at all unlikely that he might have become acquainted
with the mode of making the composition,
and also with its most remarkable properties, by
perusing some Arabian writer with whom we are at
present unacquainted.</p>

<p>This invention, by which the personal barbarity of
war has certainly been diminished, is, when considered
as a means of human destruction, by far the most
powerful that skill has ever devised, or accident presented;
acquiring, as experience shows us, a more
sanguinary dominion in every succeeding age, and
subserving all the progressive resources of science and
civilization for the extermination of mankind: which,
says Mr. Hallam, &#8220;appals us at the future prospects
of the species, and makes us feel, perhaps, more than
in any other instance, a difficulty in reconciling the
mysterious dispensation with the benevolent order of
Providence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The composition of gunpowder, as regards the proportions
of the ingredients, has not undergone any
material alteration; the chemical proportions of the
ancients being nearly those of the present day.</p>

<p>Gunpowder is an explosive propellant compound,
consisting of saltpetre or nitre, charcoal, and sulphur.
The terms, <em class="ital">explosive</em> and <em class="ital">propellant</em>, are not here used
as synonymous&mdash;they are not convertible; for a
chemical mixture may possess the <em class="ital">explosive</em> power in
a much higher degree than the <em class="ital">propellant</em>: fulminating
gold, silver, and mercury, are dreadfully explosive;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
but they have not the same projectile force, nor can
they be used as a substitute for it. Several experiments
have been made with compounds of this nature,
but the result is the reverse of what might be expected.
Nothing can resist the exceeding intensity of the
action of fulminating powder; a shot, when fired in this
way, is not projected as by gunpowder, but is split
into fragments by the velocity of its explosion, as we
shall hereafter have occasion to show.</p>

<p>Nitre, or saltpetre, is strictly the essence of gunpowder.
It is a triple compound of oxygen, nitrogen,
and potassium. The chemical action of those elements
on each other, and the play of affinities between them
at a high temperature, occasion the immense effect produced
by gunpowder on the application of fire or heat.
By universal consent, sulphur is included in the mixture,
but it is not absolutely necessary for the &#8220;propellant
power;&#8221; for nitre and charcoal only will generate
effects similar to the compound with sulphur. Gunpowder
made without sulphur has, however, several
bad qualities; it is not, on the whole, so powerful, nor
so regular in its action; it is also porous and friable,
possessing neither firmness nor solidity. It cannot
bear the friction of carriage, and in transport crumbles
into dust. The use of sulphur, therefore, appears to
be not only to complete the mechanical combination
of the other ingredients, but being a perfectly combustible
substance, it increases the general effect,
augments the propellant power, and is thought to
render the powder less susceptible of injury from atmospheric
influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There is one good reason,&#8221; says the Edinburgh
Encyclop&aelig;dia, &#8220;for the use of sulphur, although it
does not contribute to the production of any elastic
fluid. The carbonic acid which is generated would
doubtless combine with the potash, if it were not for
the presence of the sulphur, and thus so much elastic
fluid would be lost. That this is the case we know to
be true, from the fact that carbonate of potash is
always formed when nitre is decomposed by charcoal
alone, which I shall almost immediately show.&#8221; This
certainly would be the case, to a certain extent, with
gunpowder without sulphur&mdash;some carbonate of potash
would be formed.</p>

<p>The sulphur, we have no doubt, from experiments
we have made on this subject, is, in part, engaged
during the explosion of gunpowder in expelling the
sixth proportion of oxygen from the potash, so as to
combine with the potassium, to form a true sulphuret
of that metal. This fact is easily ascertained, from
the circumstance that no sulphuretted hydrogen can
be detected, by the most delicate tests, coming from
the residuum left after firing gunpowder, until moisture
has gained access to it. The bad smell which arises
sometime after the burning of gunpowder, is occasioned
by the decomposition of the moisture which the sulphuret
of potassium attracts from the atmosphere;
giving rise, by this decomposition and liberation, to
the f&#339;tid foul gas, called sulphuretted hydrogen,
and the production of potassa, or the oxide of
potassium.</p>

<p>A commission of French chemists and artillerists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was appointed by the Government, in the year 1794,
to experiment upon the best proportions and constituents
of gunpowder for the use of the French service.
The following were the proportions of five different
kinds prepared at the Essonne works:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The first and third, after 200 discharges with the
proof mortar, were declared the strongest, and the
third proportions were adopted at the recommendation
of the commissioners. Some few years elapsed,
and the first, owing to its better keeping quality, was
substituted, as it contained less charcoal, and a little
more sulphur. The French Government having always
been extremely impressed with the value of durability
in gunpowder, they have since returned to their
ancient proportions: 75 nitre, 12<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> charcoal, 12<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
sulphur. The charcoal, the absorbent of moisture,
being further reduced, and the sulphur, the preserving
ingredient, being increased in the same ratio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Napier tried a small quantity made of nitre
and charcoal only, and was much surprised to find it
project a shot as far as the best powder made in the
usual manner. It is found that, in small charges,
sulphur is advantageous; but, in charges of several
ounces, the projecting force is as great without
as with it. Therefore, under certain circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sulphur may be dispensed with; but to make a good
gunpowder, nitre and charcoal are indispensable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amongst the brilliant discoveries of modern
chemistry may be classed the development of the fact,
that a chemical combination, to constitute the same
compound, always takes place in definite and unalterable
ratios. To select one example out of a multitude:
one atom of carbon combining with two atoms of
oxygen produces the gas; because more would
answer no useful end. So, with reference to the
sulphur, if it enter into combination only with the
potassium&mdash;the base of the nitre&mdash;the sulphur should
be in that proportion to form the sulphuret of that
metal; and in this case there would be no superfluity,
for that would only add to the weight of the charge of
powder, and diminish its absolute and effective energy.
The view of the case which we have taken supposes
only two combinations, viz. carbon with oxygen, and
sulphur with potassium. Should there be a more
diversified play of affinities, and the several elements
of the powder enter into more complicated action,
accurate analysis would conduct us through all difficulties,
and point out what the proportions of the
ingredients ought to be in order to sustain that action,
and to produce a perfect ultimate result.</p>

<p>We thus perceive how analysis bears upon the case.
We can see by such reasoning on the subject, that,
theoretically, there can be but <em class="ital">one set of proportions
calculated to produce the best and strongest gunpowder</em>,
and that those proportions must depend upon
the established and unerring laws of nature. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
proportions, then, for gunpowder, by these considerations,
will be those in which the carbon will just
consume the oxygen of the nitre, and combine with
the sulphur as much as will exactly saturate the
potassium. This will be effected by an atom each
of nitre and sulphur, and three atoms of carbon; or
nitre 75&middot;5, charcoal 18&middot;8, and of sulphur 11&middot;8.</p>

<p>In the present improved state of chemical science,
when the nature of the bodies comprising gunpowder
is so well known, as well as the compounds resulting
from their action on each other, the proportions we
have named may be taken as the best for practice.</p>

<p>The charcoal should, in particular, not be less than
the nitre, as the smallest portion less than the whole
atom would be the same as to leave out the whole
atom, in which case there would be no carbonic oxide
formed. If, for example, instead of the proportions
of nitre 75&middot;5, charcoal 16&middot;2, sulphur 15, the carbon
were 16, then there would be 4&middot;2 of carbon left in
the residuum, and no carbonic oxide would be
formed, since bodies cannot unite but in definite
proportions.</p>

<p>From these considerations we can perceive the
reason why a small proportion of carbonic oxide is
always formed during the decomposition of nitre by
charcoal; for it will be evident, that as the nitric
acid contains five atoms of oxygen, four of these must
combine with two atoms of carbon to form two atoms
of carbonic acid, while the <em class="ital">odd atom of oxygen</em> is
compelled to take another atom to form carbonic
oxide. But this is not the case in the combustion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
gunpowder, as carbonic acid and nitrogen are the
principal gases generated.</p>

<p>These proportions differ from any other formula
yet prescribed; and, though different in a great degree
from the proportions laid down by various writers on
the subject, the reasons which are here given, as has
been seen, are such as carry with them a conviction
of their truth: for there cannot possibly be any
benefit arising from a greater quantity of any of these
materials than is absolutely necessary to form the
composition in question; and if the smallest quantity
be above what is requisite to consume the whole, that,
however small it may be, is highly detrimental to the
effective energy of the mass. What we may here call
clean gunpowder, such as may be used with confidence
for repeated discharges of fire-arms of any description,
is of the greatest importance; therefore, it does not
appear to us, that any given proportions are so likely
to accomplish that object as those before specified.</p>

<p>Gunpowder consists of a very intricate mixture of
sulphur, carbon (charcoal), and nitrate of potash
(nitre).</p>

<p>The proportions in which they exist are one equivalent
of nitre, one of sulphur, and three of carbon.
The great explosive power of gunpowder is due to
the sudden development from its solid constituents of
a large quantity of gases; these gases are nitrogen
and carbonic acid.</p>

<p>At the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere
these gases would occupy a space three hundred times
greater than the bulk of the gunpowder used; but
owing to the intense heat developed at the moment of
explosion, the gases occupy at least 1,500 times the
bulk of the original gunpowder. The mixture, consisting
of one equivalent of nitre, one of sulphur,
and three of carbon, would yield three equivalents
of carbonic acid, one of nitrogen, and one of
sulphuret of potassium. The change may be represented
thus,<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemform">S + C&#8323; + KONO&#8325; = 3 CO&#8322; + N + KS.</p>

<p>The only solid residue, therefore, is the sulphuret
of potassium, and this is the compound which produces
the sulphurous odour on washing out a
gun barrel; water is decomposed, sulphuretted hydrogen
and potash being the result of the decomposition.</p>

<p>Now supposing the elements of gunpowder to exist
in these proportions, it is essential, in order to secure
their perfect combination, and thus to produce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
largest possible volume of gas, that the elements
should be in the most minute state of subdivision.
Chemical action is a force exerted at insensible distances
only, and chemical substances having the
greatest affinity for each other will not combine,
unless their elements are brought into immediate
contact: thus oxygen and hydrogen may be mixed
together in the exact proportions to form water; but
no chemical combination will occur, simply because
the ultimate particles of the two gases are not
sufficiently near to each other for their chemical
affinities to be brought into play; if, however, these
gases are subjected to very strong pressure, so as to
bring their particles into immediate contact, combination
occurs, and the production of water is the
result.</p>

<p>In order to insure the perfect combination of the
elements of gunpowder the same conditions are necessary;
that is to say, the ultimate particles of the
nitre, charcoal, and sulphur, must be brought into
the most direct contact, or the explosive power of
the gunpowder will be comparatively trifling. If, for
instance, the nitre, charcoal, and sulphur be pounded
in a mortar, no explosion but a slow combustion will
occur when the mixture is ignited; so that unless this
intimate mixture of the elements is carefully attended
to in the manufacture of gunpowder, it is easy to see
that the article produced will be of comparatively
little value.</p>

<p>It is evident then that if tons of the elements of
gunpowder were stored in a warehouse which accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
caught fire, no explosion would occur from
the formation of gunpowder; though its ingredients
would greatly increase the rapidity of combustion.</p>

<p>This remark is elicited by the recollection of a
fearful explosion which took place at Gateshead in
1854.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that a warehouse caught
fire from an adjoining mill, and the explosion was
supposed to have been produced by the ignition of
the elements of gunpowder stored in the warehouse
in a crude state. The upper story of the building
contained a large quantity of crude sulphur, and the
basement story about the same quantity of nitre,
whilst chemicals of various kinds were stored in other
parts of the building; but according to the accounts
published there was no large quantity of carbon in
the warehouse; nevertheless, a terrific explosion took
place, and after a lengthened investigation, the
conclusion arrived at was this: the sulphur melting,
mixed with the nitre, gunpowder was thus
formed, and igniting, exploded, producing the terrible
effects.</p>

<p>But gunpowder may be made without sulphur,
whereas gunpowder without carbon is an impossibility;
and though the elements of gunpowder had
all been present, no explosion could have occurred,
unless they had become mixed in the intimate manner
already described.</p>

<p>It is true some of the chemical substances in the
warehouse might have produced a fearful explosion:
but a more plausible explanation is to be found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fact, that gunpowder was at that time much more
valuable abroad than at home; and it is quite possible
that some kegs of gunpowder might have been
stored away in this warehouse, until a convenient
opportunity presented itself for their removal.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks will serve to explain how it
is that powder varies so much in strength and quickness
of fire. If the elements are imperfectly incorporated,
the powder can never be equal to that which
is properly made; and the manufacturer, having ascertained
the best proportions in which to mix the
elements, had better improve his machinery for incorporating
them, rather than his knowledge of the
chemistry of gunpowder. These observations will
also serve to explain the apparent anomaly, that the
French, and some of our other continental brethren,
are held to produce a much inferior sporting gunpowder
to that which is manufactured in old England.</p>

<p>Gunpowder is now made by all the sporting gunpowder
manufacturers from No. 1 to No. 5 grain;
and it appears certain that a further increase in the
size of the grain would be advantageous; for many
years of patient and laborious experiment clearly
show, that the old notion of gunpowder being blown
out of an ordinary sized gun in an unburnt state, is one
of the &#8220;purest of vulgar errors:&#8221; such a thing
indeed cannot possibly happen unless the powder be
bad, or the gun <em class="ital">imperfectly made</em>, or injudiciously
charged.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that I am under rather than over
estimate, when I assert that six drams of ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sporting gunpowder may be beneficially and completely
exploded in a barrel of 14 bore, 2 feet 6 inches
long, with a resisting projectile one ounce in weight
above it. This, however, being more than a double
charge for such a gun, cannot be pleasantly practised;
and it is only asserted by way of argument.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, for argument&#8217;s sake, that six
drams of gunpowder are exactly consumed in passing
from the breech to the muzzle of a gun 2 feet
6 inches long, and that the shot, therefore, acquires
its greatest velocity as it leaves the muzzle, it follows
that the ordinary charge of 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drams will be wholly
consumed before it has traversed half the length of
the barrel, and consequently the charge of shot must
here acquire its greatest velocity. It is certain,
then, that the shot must travel the latter half of the
barrel at a diminished velocity, and its velocity must
continue to diminish as it passes up the barrel; for
two obvious reasons&mdash;1st, The column of air in front
of the charge is more condensed, and thus offers a
greater resistance to the exit of the charge; 2nd,
The velocity is continually diminished by the increased
friction of the charge against the barrel.</p>

<p>The perfection of projectile science is to make the
projectile acquire its greatest velocity at the instant
of leaving the muzzle; and if, by increasing the size
of the grain of gunpowder, we can diminish the
rapidity of its explosion&mdash;thus causing it to burn and
generate fresh gas up to the muzzle of the gun&mdash;the
projectile will then acquire its greatest velocity, and
leave the gun to the best advantage: this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
important point which has hitherto been overlooked,
not only in fowling-pieces, but in the expansive principle
of rifles.</p>

<p>For artillery practice of every kind, whatever the
weight of the projectile, gunpowder of a granulation
suited to the weight of that projectile is essential, if
we would produce the greatest possible effect by the
least expenditure of means.</p>

<p>In artillery, at this most important time in war&#8217;s
history, no attention whatever is paid to this essential
principle. A long 10-inch gun, a 68-pounder, and a
short 6-pounder are all charged with powder of the
same granulation; whilst by a more judicious use of
gunpowder of suitable granulation, the range might
be extended, just as it is in sporting arms, to nearly
20 per cent.</p>

<p>Artillerists seek to effect great range by doubling
the weight of the gun, and projectile monsters meet
us at all points, to become in every case &#8220;monster
failures.&#8221;</p>

<p>I fear that the most important points have been
entirely lost sight of. Instead of ascertaining whether
we have suited the projectile power to the 8-inch or
56-pounder, so as to get work from it which is now
done by the 10-inch, we have, in our anxiety to get
range, looked only to the form or material of the
gun; vital principles being totally excluded. The
construction of the gun being perfect, the question is,
can the expellant force be brought to an equal state
of perfection?</p>

<p>In order to obtain the best results from a gun, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
gun itself must be perfect in construction, and the
expellant force must be brought to bear in the best
possible manner upon the projectile; and this is
to be done by attending to the granulation of the
powder, which must be suited to the length of the gun,
to its bore, and to the weight of the projectile.</p>

<p>Common-sense, engineering skill, will demonstrate,
that according to the weight of matter to be projected
must be the nature of the expellant; <em class="ital">accumulative</em>&mdash;until
it has overcome the inertia of that matter,
<em class="ital">accelerative</em>&mdash;until it has communicated to it the
highest state of velocity its power is capable of
effecting. If, on the other hand, it is inferior to
this, science has not extracted from it the full <em class="ital">horse-power</em>
it contains; and we are uselessly expending
force and destroying our engines by undue pressure
being exerted on one part, and inferior pressure on
another; whilst by a proper distribution of that force,
durability of the cannon is insured, and from twenty-five
to thirty per cent. more work may be obtained
from an equal quantity of powder, provided its granulation
be judiciously selected according to the area
of the gun.</p>

<p>There is abundant proof that on this engineering
question we have hitherto worked by the &#8220;rule of
thumb;&#8221; prejudice having been a stumbling-block,
which nothing but stern necessity will remove. The
authorities have but just discovered this, although
their attention was directed to it several years ago.
In the year 1852, I produced before the Small Arms
Committee, at Enfield, a portion of gunpowder suited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to the expansive rifle; it was tried to a limited extent,
and dismissed with the remark, &#8220;We don&#8217;t think
there is much in it.&#8221; Experience, however, has
demonstrated the truth of my observations, for,
in all extreme range shooting with the expansive or
&#8220;Greenerian&#8221;-principled rifles, not only is considerably
greater <em class="ital">accuracy</em> obtained with it, but an
<em class="ital">increase</em> of range equivalent to fifteen or twenty
per cent.</p>

<p>Another advantage of using gunpowder of a suitable
granulation is the absence of sharp recoil; and
thus greater accuracy of range is obtained&mdash;accuracy
of range and steadiness of weapon being inseparable.</p>

<p>Large-grain gunpowder is not only a more effectual
expellant than the fine grain, but is much more safe
to use, for by using it the risk of bursting the barrel
is much lessened; as a very simple illustration will
show. If we estimate the force generated by the
usual charge of 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drachms (I confine the question
to the 14-bore gun, for uniformity) to be 5,000 lbs.,
whether the powder be fine or coarse grain, it
follows that the fine powder, igniting so rapidly,
will exert all its force on the breech end of the gun;
whereas the coarse powder, igniting less rapidly,
distributes this force over the whole length of the
barrel: hence the greater risk of a gun bursting
with fine powder than with coarse. If we suppose
the fine powder to be entirely ignited when it reaches
half way up the barrel, then the force of 5,000 lbs. is
exerted on the lower half of the barrel; but if the
coarser grain is not entirely ignited until it reaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the muzzle, then the force of 5,000 lbs. will be distributed
over the whole length of the gun.</p>

<p>But this is not all. The fine powder, igniting
almost instantaneously, exerts its force in all directions
at once, and the barrel may burst at the side
before the charge has time to move; whereas the
coarse powder, igniting as it does more slowly, first
lifts the charge, and then the volume of gas behind it
increasing as the powder becomes more thoroughly
ignited, sweeps the charge out of the barrel with a
velocity increasing towards the muzzle.</p>

<p>If time is not given for the charge to receive the
full advantage of the expansive force of the generated
air, the force is exerted, not upon the charge, but
upon the barrel of the gun itself; and that time is
necessary for the full development of this force, is
proved by the fact that miners mix their gunpowder
with sawdust, in order to diminish the rapidity of its
explosion and thus get the advantage of its force in
the distance: from the miners, then, let us learn how
to obtain the greatest benefit from this force, and
waste it not.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt of the importance of this
principle; little progress has, however, been effected
from want of scientific illustration; let it be defined
like that of steam power, and its adoption will follow
as a natural consequence.</p>

<p>For several years I have had gunpowder manufactured
of various sizes, at the sight of which most
sportsmen would express their astonishment.</p>

<p>One objection held by sportsmen to the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
grained gunpowder is that it does not come up the
nipple of the gun; now although I do not consider
this at all important, still if the specific gravity of the
gunpowder were increased by compressing 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, 2, or
3 grains of gunpowder into the space of 1 grain, by
means of hydraulic pressure, this objection would at
once be obviated; whilst at the same time, the powder
would be less liable to absorb moisture, or to become
friable with age: either of which conditions is incompatible
with good shooting.</p>

<p>The granulating of gunpowder, to be of the greatest
benefit, should be on a uniform principle; the manipulation
should be alike in all particulars, but especially
in that part of the process which determines the
specific gravity. The hydraulic pressure on the cake
should be alike in all cases: in fact, the various sizes
of grain might be produced from the same cake, and
the desired object be thus obtained. But so long
as the practice is followed of producing large grain
from less condensed cake, the article produced will
give unsatisfactory results; and the advantages which
might be attained, as my experience denotes, and
which would be of the greatest service, alike in sporting,
rifle, and artillery powder, will be nullified.</p>

<p>Great improvements are yet to be made, especially
in the powder used for artillery; whilst range,
accuracy, and lessened recoils are points which may
be determined with almost mathematical precision.</p>

<p>Great fame is in prospect for any one who can
grasp and handle well this granulation principle;
especially if he can define the sizes to be used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
different varieties of guns. Artillerists who contend
that a medium size grain, to suit all sizes of gun, is
advantageous, might as well contend that cannon of a
medium size would be preferable to so many different
sizes, because, though we lose in range, accuracy, and
recoil, it would be more convenient to have but one
sized gun.</p>

<p>In making large grained gunpowder, the manufacturers
defeat one of the main objects to be gained
by granulation, from not subjecting it to the same
amount of pressure which is necessary for the
granulation of the very fine grain. In granulating
very fine powder, it is necessary to subject the cake
to such an amount of hydraulic pressure as shall give
the mass a marble-like structure, or during the
process of granulation, the whole of it crumbles into
dust; but the coarser gunpowder may be granulated
without subjecting it to this high degree of pressure,
hence each grain is more porous and of lesser specific
gravity: a difference which it is most important to
avoid. It is clear, therefore, that according to the
present mode of manufacturing gunpowder, the large
and the fine grain are of very different kinds; the main
difference being in their specific gravities. Gunpowder
of less density burns with greater rapidity, because
it is more open and porous; and if uniform density
was observed, the diversity in the size of the grain
need not be so great; whilst, at the same time, this
anomaly might be avoided&mdash;that the same measure of
fine and large-grained gunpowder contains a difference
of the expansive element amounting to fifteen or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
twenty per cent. As gunpowder is now manufactured,
it is highly necessary in all comparative trials
to <em class="ital">weigh</em>, and not to <em class="ital">measure</em> the charge, or the
results will be deceptive and worthless. The granulation
question struggles with undeserved difficulty.
Gunmakers, either not understanding the question, or
constructing the chambers of their guns improperly,
and not using suitable nipples, decry the adoption
of large-grained gunpowder; but they forget the
increased range obtained in the killing from their
guns, and the <em class="ital">&eacute;cl&acirc;t</em> a long shot produces. In trials
of guns at thirty or forty yards, the difference in the
shooting with fine and large-grained gunpowder is
not so apparent, and the maker exclaims, &#8220;Oh! the
fine powder shoots stronger, and as close as the
coarse.&#8221; I admit this to be the case, at short distances;
but the great advantage of using the large grain is sufficiently
evident when shooting at forty-five, fifty, and
sixty yards, for then the fine grain entirely fails: simply
from the oft-repeated fact, that the fine powder is more
of a propulsive, while the large grain is an expellant
force; so that according to the law of resistance in
a&euml;riform fluids, the one is sooner reduced to medium
velocity than the other, which exerts its action
more evenly. Powder of larger grain is thus more
suitable for the larger sizes of shot, and would
give an increased range in usual shooting, for the
shot is kept better together, and is projected to
greater distances. A common way of testing the
quality of gunpowder is, to rub it between the hands,
and observe the darkness of the stain; the darker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the stain the more inferior the gunpowder is held to
be. This test is, however, decidedly fallacious, because
the gunpowder may be of low specific gravity, or it
may have become friable from age and other causes.</p>

<p>Whales are shot with gunpowder proportioned to
the weight of the harpoon required to kill them.
Duck guns of the largest calibre are comparatively
useless unless the gunpowder used is granulated
according to the weight of the projectile; and the
same law holds in regard to the most &#8220;mammoth&#8221;
engine yet to be devised by the mind of man.</p>

<p>Gun-cotton has been before the world for some
years, but, except as a curiosity, it has attracted little
public attention; neither has it gained any reputation
as a projectile force. It may be prepared by steeping
cotton wool for a few minutes in a mixture of nitric
and sulphuric acids, thoroughly washing, and then drying
at a very gentle heat. It consists chemically
of the essential elements of gunpowder: viz. carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen; but, in addition, it contains
another highly elastic gas, hydrogen. The carbon in
the fibres of the wool presents to the action of flame
a most extended surface in a small space, and the
result is an explosion approaching as nearly as possible
to the instantaneous: in consequence of its
rapid ignition it produces a violent kick; sufficient
time is not given to put heavy bodies in motion, hence
it cannot be usefully employed as a projectile agent.
No one who values his limbs should trifle with it,
for fearful accidents have resulted from its exposure
to the heat of the sun, and other very simple causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an instrument used by some sportsmen,
and strongly recommended by many gunmakers, for
testing the strength of different kinds of gunpowder.
It consists of a chamber closed by a spring, and fired
like an ordinary pistol. When the powder explodes
the spring is forced forward, and moves an index
round a graduated circle; the more quickly the
powder explodes the farther does it lift the spring;
hence this is a measure of quickness of fire, but not
of expellant force; and from the observations which
have been made on gunpowder, it must be evident
to any one who has paid the least attention to the
subject, that this instrument is utterly useless.</p>

<p>An instrument to test the comparative strength of
different kinds of gunpowder is yet a desideratum in
projectile science; and we cannot doubt that such an
instrument will be produced, when the importance of
the granulation of gunpowder is more generally known
and appreciated.</p>

<p>The charcoal formerly used was made in the
common way, by pits, which must have been seen by
almost every one. The method is now to <em class="ital">distil</em> the
wood in cast-iron cylinders, extracting the pyroligneous
acid, &amp;c., by heating them red hot, and allowing all
other volatile matter to evaporate, the charcoal only
being retained in the cylinder or retorts; hence
arises the name <em class="ital">cylinder gunpowder</em>. The best
charcoal for sporting powders is the black dog wood;
Government use willow and alder. Any charcoal
does for common powders. Charcoal is ground in the
same way as the nitre. Sulphur is purified simply by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fusing, and when in that state, skimming off the impurities:
it is cooled and pulverised in the same way
as the other two ingredients. The three ingredients,
after being carefully weighed in their due proportions,
are sifted into a large trough, and well mixed together
by the hands. They are then conveyed to the powder
mill. This is a large circular trough, having a
smooth iron bed, in which two millstones, secured to a
horizontal axis, revolve, traversing each other, and
making nine or ten revolutions in a minute. The
powder is mixed with a small quantity of water put
on the bed of the mill, and there kept subject to
the pressure of the stones; and if we calculate
the weight of the two millstones at six tons, it
follows that in four or five hours&#8217; incorporation on
this bed, it subjects the ingredients to the action of
full 10,000 tons. It is this long-continued grinding,
compounding, and blending together of the mixture,
that alone renders it useful and good. After this
intimate mixing, it is conveyed away in the shape of
mill-cake, and firmly pressed between plates of copper.
Bramah&#8217;s press has been introduced of late years&mdash;we
should say with a good deal of improvement to the
powder, as will be shown hereafter&mdash;and by its
means the mass is more compressed and in thinner
cakes. It is then broken into small pieces with
wooden mallets, and taken to the corning-house,
where it is granulated, &#8220;by putting it into sieves,
the bottoms of which are made of bullocks&#8217; hides,
prepared like parchment, and perforated with holes
about two-tenths of an inch in diameter; from twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to thirty of these sieves are secured to a large frame,
moving on an <em class="ital">eccentric</em> axis, or crank, of six inches
throw; two pieces of lignum vit&aelig;, six inches in diameter,
and two inches or more in thickness, are
placed on the broken <em class="ital">press-cakes</em> in each sieve. The
machinery being then put in rapid motion, the discs
of lignum vit&aelig; (called balls) pressing upon the
powder, and striking against the sides of the sieves,
force it through the apertures, in grains of various
sizes, on to the floor, from whence it is removed,
and again sifted through finer sieves of wire, to
separate the dust and classify the grain. One man
works two sieves at a time, by turning a handle and
eccentric crank; the sieves being fixed to a frame,
which is suspended over a bin by four ropes from the
ceiling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grains afterwards undergo a process of <em class="ital">glazing</em>,
by friction against each other, in barrels containing
nearly 200 lbs., making forty revolutions in a minute,
and lasting several hours, according to the fancy of
the purchaser. This part of the business we entirely
disagree with, as injurious to the quick and <em class="ital">certain
ignition</em>. Gunpowder is finally dried by an artificial
temperature of 140&deg; Fahrenheit, which is
suffered gradually to decline. The last process is
sifting it clear of dust, and then packing it in
canisters or otherwise.</p>

<p>The utility of the process of granulation results
from the impossibility of firing mealed powder
sufficiently simultaneously to effect an explosion;
and also from the fact that gunpowder, in a mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
does not explode. Fire a solid piece of mill-cake,
and it does not flash off like unto granulated
powder, but burns gradually, though with an extreme
fury, until the whole is consumed. This arises
from its density, the compression in the press; it
also teaches us one fact, that to be of the greatest
service, the time each grain should occupy in
burning should be proportioned to the size of the gun
for which it is required; since it is clear that the
explosion of a heap of gunpowder is but the rapid
combustion of all its parts. This action, as is well
known, is so rapid, even in a large quantity of
powder, that it appears to be a sudden and simultaneous
burst of flame; though philosophically and
actually it is not so.</p>

<p>Fine grain, when unconfined, explodes quicker than
large, or is sooner burnt out, and consequently generates
more force in the same period of time; but
when it comes to large quantities, its very quickness
is detrimental to its force, by condensing the air
around the exterior of the mass of fluid which thus
constrains its bound. In small quantities, the proportion
of condensation is not so apparent, and hence
the reason why greater velocities can be obtained with
small arms than with cannon.</p>

<p>There exists a diversity of opinion in regard to the
strength or projectile force of gunpowder. Dr. Ure
remarks&mdash;&#8220;If we inquire how the maximum gaseous
volume is to be produced from the chemical reaction
of the elements of nitre on charcoal and sulphur, we
shall find it to be by the generation of carbonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
oxide and sulphurous acid, with the disengagement
of nitrogen. This will lead us to the following proportions
of these constituents:</p>

<p>&#8220;The nitre contains five primes of oxygen, of which
three combining with the three of charcoal, will
furnish three of carbonic oxide gas, while the remaining
two will convert the one prime of sulphur into
sulphurous acid gas. The single prime of nitrogen is
therefore, in this view, disengaged alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gaseous volume, in this supposition, evolved

<p>being an expansion of one volume into 787&middot;3. But
as the temperature of the gases, at the instant of
their combustive formation, must be incandescent, this
volume may be safely estimated at three times the
above amount, or considerably upwards of 2,000 times
the bulk of the explosive solid.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is obvious that the more sulphur, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sulphurous acid will be generated, and the less
forcibly explosive will be the gunpowder. This was
confirmed by the experiments at Essonne, where the
gunpowder that contained twelve of sulphur, twelve
of charcoal, in 100 parts, did not throw the proof
shell so far as that which contained only nine of
sulphur and fifteen of charcoal. The conservative
property is, however, of so much importance for
humid climates and our remote colonies, that it
justifies a slight sacrifice of strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;When in a state of explosion, the volume,&#8221; Dr.
Hutton calculates, &#8220;is at least increased eight times,
and hence its immense power. The pressure exerted,
if in a state of confinement, will depend on the
dimensions of the vessel containing it; so that it
would be no difficult undertaking to obtain any
pressure above that of the atmosphere, up, we may
fearlessly say, to the enormous amount of 4,000 lbs.
per square inch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same quantity of gunpowder subjected to a
variety of experimental tests, differs materially in
its results; at the same time it is only by such a
method that we can arrive at the relative strength
or power which it possesses. Dr. Hutton, whose
authority in all mathematical calculations is very
high, and whose opinions and judgment in matters
of this nature ought not to be unthinkingly controverted,
states 2,000 feet per second (with cannon)
as the highest velocity which any projectile had
attained, at the time of his writing, which had gunpowder
for its propellant power. A much greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
velocity is now given in all guns fired at high elevations.
&#8220;Monks&#8217;&#8221; gun attained a velocity of 2,400
feet in the first second of its flight, and this is now
exceeded by rifled cannon.</p>

<p>This advantage does not arise, in our opinion, so
much from the superior quality of the gunpowder,
as from the improvements which have taken place
in the manner of applying it. For instance, where
experiments are conducted, as was the case with
Dr. Hutton, with moving <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eprouvettes</i>, a certain
loss is sustained, in the same degree as the instrument
is made to recoil from its original position;
therefore, by restraining the recoil, an increase of
momentum is given to the projectile, to the same
extent as had been exerted upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eprouvette</i>, or
cannon, in driving it several feet backward; and
instead of dividing the force thus acquired between
the shot and the gun, by having the latter firmly
fixed and the recoil destroyed, the whole power
is exerted upon the former, and its velocity accelerated
in the same proportion.</p>

<p>Gunpowder, though astonishing in its effect,
and tremendous in power, may nevertheless be
controlled within a limited sphere, and bounds put
upon its destructive energy. The following curious
experiment, first tried at Woolwich on a small scale,
has since been carried out to a great extent. Screw
into each end of the breech part of a gun-barrel a
well-fitted plug; drill a communication, and put in
a nipple; having filled the barrel with powder,
screw in the breech, and fire a cap on it, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
explosive fluid will escape by the small orifice like
steam from a pipe. If the barrel be good, it may
safely be held in the hand, merely using a towel to
protect the hand from the heat the barrel absorbs.
We have done it repeatedly with no inconvenience,
and even carried this experiment much further;
firing two ounces of the best powder in a barrel of
good quality (though not in the hand) yet the barrel
did not receive any violent motion by which it could
be inferred that it might not be done with safety.</p>

<p>We have before observed, that, with very short
guns, fine gunpowder produces the greatest result,
inasmuch as there is no greater column of air in the
barrel than the explosive fluid is equal to <em class="ital">displace</em>;
or, in other words, the charge leaving the muzzle
of the gun at the very moment when the explosive
force is strongest, all the power is thus obtained of
which it is capable; but if used in a longer barrel,
and the fluid has obtained its greatest power when
the charge has twelve inches of the barrel still to
travel, the column of compressed air yet remaining in
the muzzle of the barrel, exerts a resisting influence,
in proportion to its density, upon the charge, and
creates a dangerous and unpleasant recoil.</p>

<p>If a cartridge be placed in the centre of an open
barrel eight feet in length, having a bullet abutting
at each end large enough to fill the barrel, and a
touch-hole is drilled as near the centre of the
cartridge as possible, when it is fired, the balls
will certainly be discharged from the barrel, but
with a very small degree of force: in fact, merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
driven out. With the same instrument, vary the
experiment: place in it a cartridge charged with
one ball, three feet from the muzzle, leaving a
column of air five feet in length to act against
the explosive force of the gunpowder, and the ball
will be driven one hundred yards with considerable
force. Again, let a third cartridge be introduced
similar to the last, two feet from the muzzle, increasing
the column of air to six feet; and the result, in distance
and velocity, will nearly double what has been
obtained by the last experiment; tending to prove that
air thus forced back upon itself obtains a density, and
consequent resisting influence, nearly equal to a well-screwed
breech. In order to test this principle further,
I put into the same tube a double charge of gunpowder,
merely backed by a wadding, two feet from the muzzle,
and then rammed down four balls as tight as possible
into the short portion; in discharging it, the tube was
burst immediately in rear of the charge.</p>

<p>In another experiment, I took a common musket
barrel, having a plug of iron firmly fixed into the
muzzle; the breech being unscrewed, and a ball introduced
one-tenth of an inch less in diameter than the
bore of the barrel, together with one drachm of gunpowder,
I then fired the gunpowder, and the explosive
matter escaped by the touch-hole. On examination,
it was found that the ball was flattened to the extent
of one-third of its sphere. The charge for the next
experiment was increased to two drachms; when the
ball in the discharge struck the muzzle very slightly,
altering its shape in the least conceivable degree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The charge was next increased to three drachms, and
the ball was extracted without any perceptible defect.
In the fourth trial, another drachm was added, with
which the effect was greater than the tube was able
to resist; it was in consequence burst, about three
inches from the muzzle.</p>

<p>From this I infer that, in the first trial, the
velocity of the ball was not so great, but that the
air escaped past it, by what is technically called the
windage, allowing it to strike the plug at the end of
the barrel with sufficient force to alter the shape of
the lead in the manner described. The second trial
gave an increased velocity; the opposing forces being
so nearly balanced that the ball scarcely reached the
end of the barrel, and was very little injured. In the
third trial the velocity became so great, and the air
was condensed to such an extent, that the ball struck
upon a cushion-like surface so highly elastic that it
was extracted without the least injury to its shape.
The last charge was too powerful, inasmuch as the
lateral pressure of compressed air rent the tube asunder.</p>

<p>The one great cause of this and other barrels bursting,
arises from the velocity becoming too great, and
thus driving back the air upon itself, until the mutual
repulsion of the particles forms an almost impenetrable
barrier, exerting a lateral pressure on the
barrel, and resisting the passage of the elastic fluid.
To make the explanation plain; supposing that the
charge had condensed the air for the distance of
three or four inches immediately preceding it, and
then come to rest, the waves of vibration, travelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
at the rate of 1,300 feet per second, would communicate
to the remainder of the column the same
pressure, and an equilibrium would take place. But
this not being the case, and the air becoming still
more highly compressed by the velocity not decreasing
but increasing, the lateral pressure becomes
greater than the fibres of the iron are able to withstand,
and consequently the barrel is burst. Many
accidents arise from this cause solely, and without
any blame being attached to either the maker or user
of the gun. While on this subject, we may remark that
this is the more likely, inasmuch as the powder with
which barrels are proved is not the strongest, and is
also of a large grain; so that it is quite within the
range of probability that a barrel may, and it does
often, stand proof, and yet burst when it comes to
be used with extremely fine-grained strong powder;
as it is quite clear that a high velocity must create
danger.</p>

<p>To pursue the subject still further: in order to
procure conclusive evidence in support of this argument,
I had a tube of iron manufactured, sufficiently
good in quality to bear an enormous pressure; it was
three feet in length, with a bore large enough to
admit an ounce ball, and the sides of the arch were
full a quarter of an inch in thickness. A piece of steel,
one inch in length, was then turned of a size to fit the
bore well, but not so tight as to prevent its free action:
this I called a piston. From the centre of the tube
to the muzzle, were drilled, on all sides, a number
of small holes, a quarter of an inch distant from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
each other, in all amounting to sixty-eight; these
were fitted with small pieces of steel needles,
hardened, projecting into the interior of the tube
a quarter of an inch, so that the piston, in its
upward movement, should strike these pins, and
thus enable me to judge how far it was driven by
each experiment. Each end of the tube was then
fitted with a breech, firmly screwed in; the upper
one having a flat internal surface, the lower one,
where ignition was to be communicated, being a
conical or patent breech. This machine I termed an
explosion metre; and it answered its purpose. With
two drachms of the best canister gunpowder, the
piston was propelled nineteen inches along the tube;
breaking eight pins. The same quantity of the
fine diamond grain reached only eighteen inches,
or four pins. No. 3 grain, of both Laurence&#8217;s and
Pigou and Wilks&#8217; manufacture, reached twenty-four
inches, or twenty-eight pins. A very superior
powder, containing in one grain five of diamond,
four of canister, and two of the above makers&#8217; No. 2,
reached twenty-seven inches, and broke forty pins.
In each of these experiments the greatest accuracy
was observed, in preparing the metre as well as in
weighing the charge.</p>

<p>These facts go far to prove that, in all uses of
gunpowder, the grain should be of a size proportioned
to the length and bore of the gun; for if we
have not an accelerating force to overcome the
increasing resistance of the compressed column of
air in the barrel, there is great danger that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
gun may be burst, and probably be productive of
great mischief; whilst a judicious application of the
extraordinary power thus placed at our disposal, may
be alike conducive to our safety and our pleasure.
A musket ball can be driven through an half-inch
boiler plate; but this can only be accomplished by
using as much powder as will generate a gradually,
though rapidly, increasing power, until the ball has
passed the limits of the tube.</p>

<p>Nitre is not the only salt which has been employed
in the manufacture of gunpowder. Its quantity or
proportion in the mixture has been lessened, and the
deficiency supplied by another elementary combination;
namely, by the chlorate of potassa.</p>

<p>The French succeeded in making powder of which
potassa forms one of the component parts, and they
say it ranges the projectile double the distance; but
this is doubtful. The proportions of the mixture are
nitrate of potash twenty-five parts, chlorate of potassa
forty-five, sulphur fifteen, charcoal seven and a half,
and lycopodium seven and a half parts. In the year
1809, a similar kind of powder was proposed to the
English Government, by a person of the name of
Parr; but its introduction was very properly opposed
by Sir William Congreve, on account of the danger
attending its use, and also from the fact that there
was no piece of ordnance in the service able to withstand
its effects. The proportions were, chlorate of
potassa six parts, fine charcoal one part, sulphur one
part. These ingredients to be <em class="ital">carefully</em> mixed
together and granulated. The above mixture was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
laid aside, not only from the want of power to restrain
its effects, but because it was useless, from the very
extreme rapidity of its explosion: it forms the
atmospheric air into a wall of adamant, by the condensation
confining it to a comparatively small space;
it becomes lightning&mdash;an electric fluid, which, from
its very intensity, cannot displace any great mass of
air.</p>

<p>Neither can any advantage arise from any greater
velocity in projectile force, except we can obtain
that by a graduated scale; for masses cannot, from a
state of rest, be put in extreme motion instantaneously:
philosophy teaches us, and experience makes it
evident, that a portion of time must be occupied, however
short that may be. All motion is gradual, and
cannot be obtained otherwise; and hence the fact,
that lightning conveyed into a tube filled with projectiles
would not drive them out: it would not project
them, but the blow would break them in pieces. So is
it with this mixture; it is useless from its very rapidity
of ignition. We have shown that even fine grain gunpowder
is too quick, and that its quickness destroys
its power; how much more so is the other: and what
would it avail us, with these disadvantages.</p>

<p>A writer mentions what he conceives to be a curious
fact: he says, &#8220;If a train of gunpowder be crossed at
right angles by a train of fulminating mercury, laid
on a sheet of paper on a table, and the gunpowder
lighted by a red hot wire, the flame will run on until
it meets the cross train of fulminating mercury, when
the inflammation of the latter will be so instantaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as to cut off the connection with the continuous train
of gunpowder, leaving one half of the train unignited:&#8221;
and again, &#8220;If the fulminating powder be lighted
first, it will go straight on, and pass through the
train of gunpowder so rapidly as not to inflame it at
all.&#8221; True; and the cause is quite apparent: the
rapidity of combustion condenses the air so quickly, as
to remove the grains of gunpowder liable to come in
contact with the flame, and to form the condensed air
into a line of demarcation: for heat cannot be taken
up by the air quicker than the atmosphere will convey
sound; and before the heat can evaporate the explosion
is over, and is consequently noiseless.</p>

<p>In all mining operations: in the quarrying of stone,
the destruction of sunken rocks, or in any other operations
where it is desirable to detach large masses, the
use of gunpowder is indispensable; not only because
it decreases manual exertion but also because it
can be used under circumstances and in situations
unapproachable by other means. It becomes, therefore,
a consideration for the miner what kind is best
suited for the purpose; the finest grained powder is
useless as is well known: it is also more expensive; but
its principal defect arises from its quickness of combustion.
Masses cannot be detached without first putting
the whole in motion; and as this cannot be done in a very
short time, it is necessary to prolong the explosion,
so that the wave of vibration may have time to travel
throughout the whole of the mass acted upon; and a
repetition of these waves is necessary before any mass
can move. Now, to obtain this, it is necessary that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
matter be so incorporated with the powder as to prolong
that explosion; bituminous substances might be
applied with effect, for their slow burning would keep
the heat necessary to hold the permanent gases at
their utmost stretch of expansion.</p>

<p>It is obvious, from the extremely high character
English sporting gunpowder has obtained all over the
world, that considerable improvement must have
been effected by the private manufacturers, either in
the purification or manipulation of ingredients; indeed
the unwearied care bestowed on this point by several of
our best makers is beyond all praise. To explain the
various methods, or otherwise enlarge upon this point,
would be injurious to individual skill and enterprise,
and be the means of imparting knowledge to those who
have not ability to invent, but who gather from the
brains of others. The French set great value on the
&#8220;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Poudre de Chasse</span>&#8221; of England. It is rather singular
that we should excel those who pride themselves so
much on their chemical knowledge; but, as before
remarked, it is certain that the intimate incorporation
of the ingredients is of more importance than the
chemical proportions.</p>

<p>All military and naval gunpowder is not manufactured
of the greatest strength that can be acquired
&#8220;<em class="ital">at the Government mills</em>;&#8221; a sample is furnished
to each contractor with each contract, and to this
strength he is limited.</p>

<p>The fame of our English gunpowder makers is
patent to all the world, and, where skill is equal, to
name one rather than another would be invidious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
though we must not lose sight of the facts herein established.
&#8220;Granulation,&#8221; properly understood, is an
equivalent point to either chemical or mechanical
knowledge and manipulation in gunpowder manufacture.
Great anxiety to meet the wishes of the sporting
world on this point, and to advance with the age, has
been aroused; and specimens have been kindly furnished
to me, not by one, but by all the following
celebrated makers: Messrs. Pigou and Wilks, Curtis
and Harvey, Lawrence and Son, John Hall and Son;
and I have received also a very excellent specimen
from the Scotch mills.</p>

<p>Gunpowder of five sizes of granulation, on the basis
before alluded to: namely, No. 2, containing two
quantities of No. 1, and No. 3, three, and so on in progression;
but it is imperative that all the various sizes
be produced from the same mill cake, or be otherwise
of the same condensation or specific gravity, and in all
experiments of comparison, equal weights are a &#8220;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine
qu&acirc; non</span>,&#8221; otherwise the comparison will be futile; as
measure is, for these very obvious reasons, inapplicable
in comparative tests. When these points are carefully
attained, increased power of killing, &#8220;decreased
recoil,&#8221; and much greater safety, will be the important
benefits which the gunpowder manufacturers will
confer on every one using a gun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="chapname">ARTILLERY.</span></h2>

<p>Arcualia, from &#8220;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcus</span>, a bow,&#8221; appears to have been
the original name, and included all sorts of &#8220;missiles,&#8221;
as well as the engines by which they were propelled.
The sling, still in common use by the Arabs on the
banks of the upper Euphrates, being most probably
the first kind of artillery, and the bow and arrow a
succeeding stage of improvement.</p>

<p>Artillery, now in the general acceptance of the
term, includes all and every description of gun, of
greater power and dimensions than muskets and other
shoulder guns.</p>

<p>Modern civilization, with its giant strides of improvement,
has rejected the cumbrous and unsightly
complication of springs, levers and wheels; and given
to us, in their stead, the light and handsome six-pounder
cannon; which is so easy of transit that it can
accomplish the most complex and difficult movements,
while the horses are at their fullest gallop. A single
minute now suffices to stop when at the greatest speed,
unlimber, load, fire a couple of rounds, and remount;
the gun is speedily at a distance&mdash;while the eye
can scarcely follow, or the mind imagine, the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that must follow when the &#8220;deep-tongued gun&#8221;
is fired in attack.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to notice the comparative effects
of guns of various calibre and power, and attempt to
convey to the reader a distinct idea of their respective
defects and advantages. The artillery of
England comprises an immense variety of weapons
of war, suited for various purposes and situations,
as experience has dictated, or necessity required.
The present state of our artillery requires <em class="ital">an
advance to the front</em>, to be in a line with the march
of science, as regards the knowledge of gunpowder
and projectiles; I may, therefore, be permitted to
animadvert on what appears to me to need improvement.</p>

<p>The profession may think it presumptuous in me
to offer a suggestion or give an opinion; for it too frequently
happens that individuals, who have employed
their whole time and study on one especial subject,
think they alone can understand it, and consider any
opposition to their opinions, or any doubt of the
soundness of their conclusions, little short of a positive
offence.</p>

<p>Having given considerable attention to the subject,
I would now beg to offer some remarks on the Government
arrangements of gunnery, which are not yet so
perfect as they might be.</p>

<p>The authorities of the Ordnance Department are,
I am sorry to state, too remiss in considering, and
too unwilling to avail themselves of valuable improvements
and discoveries; clinging too much to prejudice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in favour of whatever has been heretofore in use.
To such an extent is this habit carried, that many
improvements become familiar to half the kingdom,
aye, and are adopted by other countries, before
our guides take advantage of them: for truly talent
and ingenuity are but scantily patronized by them.
My wish is to aid in sweeping away the cobwebs
which still hang on the science of great gunnery; and
to push the spur of conviction deep, that instead of
Britain following, she may, in a time of peace, lead
the way in improvements; so that whenever war
returns, she may not be unprepared to wage it on
equal terms.</p>

<p>I have in this chapter endeavoured to divest the
subject of all extraneous matter, and impart as much
information as will enable the reader to form an
opinion for himself, and understand something of a
science hitherto considered abstract, and which is, no
doubt, abstruse. This I have sought to effect in
plain language, avoiding, wherever it was possible, all
technicalities.</p>

<p>The guns of the British nation may be divided into
four classes&mdash;Park, or Field artillery, Siege guns, or
battering train, garrison guns, and marine artillery.
The numbers of different descriptions of rates, or
weight of guns, vary in all the different classes of the
service. There are light, medium, and heavy six-pounders;
long and short twenty-four pounders; and
two or more weights in all the varieties, even up to
the ten-inch gun and thirteen-inch mortar. We have
iron ordnance and brass, for long and short ranges, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
small or great velocity. The rate, weight, length,
charges, point blank, extreme range, &amp;c., of iron
guns, will be found in the annexed table, by which
will be seen, at a glance, the various matters referred
to.</p>

<p>Brass guns are invariably lighter, and considered
less likely to burst. Gun metal, technically so called,
is a compound of copper and tin, in the proportion of
five, eight, and ten pounds of the latter to 100 pounds
of the former. The peculiar property of the tin is to
give hardness and solidity to the mass. The greater
proportions are used principally for mortars, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
require a greater degree of hardness than other guns.
A peculiar property attaches to the using of brass
guns. If a considerable number of rounds be fired
in rapid succession, the bore of the gun becomes to
a certain extent elliptical. This peculiarity arises
entirely from the extreme windage allowed by the
present established rules of British gunnery; and is
produced by the tendency of the shot, when propelled
by the explosive force, to strike upwards from the
breech, and then rebound downwards, and so on till it
reaches the muzzle. Iron guns are not liable to this
(although the same cause exists) from the unductile
nature of the cast iron.</p>

<p>Brass guns are, after certain use, recast: this is done
solid, with the cascable of the gun downwards, to give
a greater density to the metal at the breech. The
boring and turning are performed simultaneously by a
very simple arrangement. At the siege of Badajos,
the firing continued for 104 hours, and the number of
rounds that each gun fired averaged 1,249; and at
the siege of Sebastian, the quantity fired by each gun
was about 350 rounds, in 15<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> hours. These guns
being of iron, none of them were rendered unserviceable;
though three times the number of brass guns
would not have been equal to such long and rapid
firing. All brass guns are bouched with a bolt of
copper at the vent, on the same principle as flint guns
for sporting were formerly with gold or platina;
copper withstanding the rapid escape of the flame
better than the gun-metal. The charges, ranges, &amp;c.,
are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The twelve, ten, and eight-inch guns, almost form
a class of themselves, known as the &#8220;Paixhan Gun.&#8221;
They are intended for throwing both hollow and solid
shot. The larger are the description of ordnance with
which we at present arm our steam frigates.</p>

<p>These are unquestionably part of the many doubtful
descriptions of artillery which have been adopted of
late years, with a view to <em class="ital">fracture</em> more than to secure
a range of projectile. They are enormous machines,
as will be seen on reference to their weights, as given
in the following table; and their splintering powers
are certainly very extensive indeed. But their range
is contemptibly small, if we take into consideration
their great weight. The effect of the explosion of the
charge of one of these guns must be sensibly felt even
by the strongest built steamer in the world. They
are used with traversing beds. The gun carriage,
when recoiling, in a backward direction, being driven
up an inclined railway, with from 3&deg; to 4&deg; of elevation,
from the cascable of the gun. This greatly tends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to lessen the distance which the gun would be driven
back, and facilitates the running out of the piece to
the point of discharge. The woodcut gives a representation
of the traversing beds; and the following
table displays the ranges, &amp;c., of this class of heavy
artillery.</p>

<p>Mortars are intended for three purposes; firstly,
to bombard a town, or injure the defenders&#8217; artillery;
secondly, to fire or overthrow the works, and to spread
havoc and slaughter among the troops; thirdly, to
break through the vaulted roofs of barracks and
magazines which are not bomb-proof, or, in other
terms, are not strong enough to resist the fire.</p>

<p>They consist, as will be seen, of five descriptions,
but the 10-inch is considered, on the score of economy,
as equal to all useful purposes. The French have, at
various times, constructed mortars of enormously large
dimensions, but certainly with no useful result. The
monster mortar, used at the siege of Antwerp, fired
only ten or twelve shots, and with comparatively
little effect. It burst some time after, while under a
course of experiment, with a considerably less charge
than it had formerly withstood; thus affording one
very conclusive and illustrative fact in the theory of
vibrations in metals: for there can be no question but
that the shell, from the smallness of the charge, was
too long detained in the mortar; the waves of vibration
caused by the explosive force moving so rapidly
through the mass that the metal at last lost its cohesive
nature from their very rapid succession.</p>

<p>It will be perceived, on reference to the adjoining
tables, that ranges are obtained by the modifications
of charges.</p>

<p>Carronades are a short description of ordnance
without trunnions, but fastened by a loop under the
reinforce. Their construction is materially different
from that of guns. They have a chamber like a
mortar, a part scooped out inside the muzzle, forming
a cup, and they have also a patch on the reinforce.
The name arises from the Carron Foundry in Scotland,
the first of them having been cast there in 1779.
The construction is considerably lighter than that of
guns of similar calibre. Their principal use is on
board ship; but they are sometimes used in casemates,
or retired flanks of fortresses.</p>

be conceivable how such light guns can project such
heavy shot.</p>

<p>The recoil, which in all the before-mentioned guns
is very great, arises from the blow communicated to
the iron in immediate contact with the explosive
fluid. The granulatory system of the metal transmits
to those grains, or crystals, immediately behind them,
the blow or concussion they are subjected to, and
these again to others, and so on, until the vibration
has passed through the metal, from the interior of the
breech to the exterior of the gun.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that in all small guns, from their
slight substance, recoil is communicated a great deal
quicker than in larger ones; hence arises the well-known
fact that in shooting you receive a knock
nearly simultaneous with the explosion. The greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and heavier the gun (even carry it up to General
Miller&#8217;s gun of 84 cwt.) if the proportion which the
shot bears to it be not too great, the less will be the
velocity of recoil. But in carronades, as will be seen,
the proportions are as high as 1 to 55, while in long
guns, it is 1 to 429; a very considerable degree of
difference.</p>

<p>Our ancestors had but a limited knowledge of the
laws of projecting bodies by gunpowder. Their explosive
power was not good; for there is clear proof, even
since the time of Robins, that the purification of the
ingredients has nearly doubled the explosive force.
The mechanical construction and outer mould of
their guns, were calculated to resist and limit the
effects of recoil to a great extent.</p>

<p>Accumulation of metal in the rear of the breech-end
of a gun is true science, and of so easy an
attainment, that wonder arises in the mind why it has
not been effected. The extent to which this principle
is worked upon in our gunnery is very trifling;
though recoil can by this simple arrangement be
nearly destroyed, or so lessened as to add considerable
percentage of range to the projectile. Add
no considerable weight to the gun, but add it
judiciously, behind the end of the chamber and vent,
and immediately surrounding the breech. I have
tried this to a great extent, on a small scale, &#8220;with
fowling-piece barrels,&#8221; and find that the greatest
advantage arises from an additional inch of metal
to the extreme end of the barrel, as the recoil is
thereby lessened; while, on the contrary, by reducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the exterior end of the breech, until it becomes
of less thickness than the sides of the barrel,
the recoil is doubled. Guns will some day be
constructed as mortars are, with the axles, or trunnions,
in rear of the tube and of the vent; for by
this arrangement recoil would act less on the mass
of metal forming the gun, and more on the base
from which it is fired. We are quite aware that an
arrangement of this nature could only be applied to
certain descriptions of ordnance, and in certain
situations; but on forts, or batteries commanding
rivers and bays, and even in the bows of steam vessels,
they may be placed with great advantage. But this objection
may be started: &#8220;You could not use guns fitted
in this manner horizontally, or nearly so.&#8221; Why not?
The muzzle could be as easily raised or depressed as
the breech, by mechanical means. I should much
like to see the principle tried, and I hope to do so.</p>

<p>The following results of experiments prove, that if
a true basis is not laid down, all the fabric raised
upon it is but one of sand, which will crumble
away from under us. Hutton says,&mdash;&#8220;Varying the
weight of the gun, produced no change in the velocity
of the ball. The guns were suspended in the same
manner as the pendulous blocks, and additional
weights were attached to the pieces, so as to restrain
the recoil; but although the arcs of the recoil were
thus shortened, yet the velocity of the ball was not
altered by it. The recoil was then entirely prevented,
but the initial velocity of the ball remained the
same.&#8221; No doubt this was the result of his experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
by the pendulous suspension of the gun:
but here he erred; for had he suspended a thousand
tons to it, without incorporating it in the gun, the
result would still have been the same. All the
improvements effected, or yet to be accomplished, will
be obtained by a concentration of metal.</p>

<p>An excess of weight in the fore part of a gun is very
injurious, by inducing and lengthening the tremulous
vibration created by the explosion. The only necessity
for strength forward in a cannon, arises from the
necessity of resisting the lateral pressure from the
condensation of the column of air in the tube. The
pressure of the explosive gases is, by the velocity
obtained before reaching the fore part, of very little
amount, from the short period it is exerted on the
interior. Therefore weight, in the fore part of a gun,
be it ever so great, will not prevent recoil if there is
not a proportionate quantity behind. It will retard or
lessen the distance to which the recoil will drive the
gun and carriage, but the evil is then over.</p>

<p>If the slightest movement occurs in the gun, the shot
is projected from an unsound base or foundation. It is
precisely similar to a man who, in the act of throwing
a stone, slips his foot backwards: the effect is at
once apparent on the stone. If the trunnion of a gun
breaks in the discharge, or a quoin flies out, the shot is
materially affected; never ranging, under such circumstances,
the accustomed distance, nor with its usual
accuracy. Practice with mortars proves beyond dispute
the necessity of a firm base for the gun, for with a
much less charge they project a greater mass farther.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
A mortar discharged on land, exceeds in range the
same description of gun on board of ship, or on the
best-constructed platform. In truth, this is but
another illustration of a law of nature: if you have
not a solid fulcrum, it matters little what the power
of your lever may be. Gunpowder is a powerful
lever if exploded on a solid base; if not, its effects
become limited in proportion. Unquestionably, much
may yet be gained by an economical arrangement of
our projectile force. Great and rapid as have been the
acquisitions of knowledge in everything relating to
gunnery in modern times, there still remains, I have
no doubt, an unexplored mine of valuable treasure to
be added to the science.</p>

<p>It would effect a great improvement in the mortars
used by the navy, destroying the tremendous vibration
and shake given to the ship, increasing their efficiency
and aiding the projecting power, to place them on beds
of the softest lead, not less than twelve inches in
thickness. Though this suggestion is only theoretical,
experience would soon determine the least degree of
substance available. Advantage would arise, in the
first place, from the non-conducting tendency of the
lead; in the second, from its density, and, of course,
incompressibility. The one protecting the ship, the
other being the most solid bed for the mortar that can
by possibility be obtained.</p>

<p>The weight of a hollow 13-inch shell is 190 lbs.;
the bursting powder 6 lbs. 8 oz.; the weight, if cast
solid, would be 290 lbs.: thus the action of so large
a body on the atmosphere must be immense of itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
There seems to be much difficulty in projecting
masses of great diameter, from this cause; and this
should lead us to seek, as indeed it points to, another
material for fabricating projectiles. As weight is less
in substance, and, of course, less in space, much less
resistance, in proportion, will exist in a bore of six
inches than in one of twelve; and a greater projectile
force will be generated with fewer countervailing
disadvantages.</p>

<p>The first step in the vast improvements about
to be effected in gunnery, has been successfully
taken by Mr. Monk, of Woolwich arsenal, who has
induced the authorities to allow a gun to be made from
drawings and calculations of his own. The dimensions
of the gun are as follows: length from cascable to
muzzle, 11 feet; weight, 97 cwt. 3 qrs.; bore, 7<sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inches;
weight of solid shot, 55 lbs.; shell, 42 lbs.; windage,
0&middot;175; charge, 16 lbs. of powder; giving a range, at
32&deg; of elevation, of 5,327 yards. <em class="ital">A compound shot</em>,
(a shell filled with lead), was projected 5,720 yards, or
<em class="ital">three miles and a quarter</em>, at a velocity, during the
first second of time, of 2,400 feet per second, and
occupying during the whole flight only 29<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> seconds.
The comparative weight of gun and shot is 1 to 220.</p>

<p>A course of experiments, extending over seventeen
years, has firmly established this gun as the best ever
yet constructed. Many attempts have been made to
excel it, but all have failed. Guns have been made
on drawings varying not more than three-tenths
of an inch in their dimensions from those of his
gun, and, with extreme <em class="ital">modesty</em>, the individuals have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
claimed a right to compete with Mr. Monk; and
have even obtained competing trials, without any
claim whatever to the discovery of the principle of
it; coming into competition by no just claim or
merit, but solely from the tendency to supersede any
improvement emanating from a <em class="ital">civilian</em>. Eighteen,
twenty-four, and thirty-two pounders are now, however,
constructed on this model;&mdash;indeed the
improvement is so great and so apparent, as to
overcome every obstacle as yet thrown in its way.</p>

<p>With no wish to detract from the merit of Mr.
Monk&#8217;s invention (upon which I congratulate him and
the country) but, in justice to myself, I may remind
some of my readers, that in &#8220;The Gun,&#8221; published
early in 1835, I clearly laid down the principle in
<em class="ital">projectile force</em>, on which this gun is constructed;
and as he has since so successfully accomplished this
great improvement, he must permit me to say, that
the principle is the same which I have striven for, for
many years.</p>

<p>Wilkinson says, &#8220;Guns cast on this principle,
although several hundredweight lighter altogether,
recoil less than those on the old plan, with equal
charges of powder and ball, in consequence of the
weight being <em class="ital">properly</em> distributed.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;One
remarkable fact attended these experiments, namely,
that by increasing the windage a little, the range was
increased also, contrary to the received opinion; but
this may be explained by the circumstance, that with
very great velocities, and long guns, the column of air
to be displaced before the ball quits the gun is considerable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and is condensed so rapidly, that it offers
immense resistance to the passage of the bullet, if it
fit the bore closely; but, by reducing the size of the
ball, and thus increasing the windage, the air has
more space to rush round it, and the ball escapes with
greater facility.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the condensed air prevented the velocity being
greater, it argues most clearly, that there was an
insufficiency of explosive matter to keep up the
velocity until the ball of less windage left the muzzle;
and the result with the ball of greater windage establishes
this assumption. For if the condensed air
was allowed to pass the ball by the windage into the
tube, it proves beyond doubt that there was a deficiency
of matter there, or that the pressure without
was greater than that within. How otherwise could
such a result occur? It is a clearly established fact,
that with the generality of ordnance, a full waste of
one-fourth of explosive force, if not more, occurs by the
<em class="ital">elastic fluid</em> escaping past the ball by the windage, instead
of the reverse. Neither could the condensed air
rush into the gun by the windage if there are any <em class="ital">permanent
gases</em> generated; which Mr. Wilkinson himself
says there are, to the extent of &#8220;250 times the bulk of
the powder in grain.&#8221; These would offer a sufficient
resistance to prevent the condensed air rushing in.
I have found, by an experiment before described, that
a ball driven against a column of air which has no
escape, if the velocity be trifling, say 800 feet per
second, the air will escape by the windage; but double
this even, and it is so condensed as to form a cushion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for the ball to strike against. Then how much less
will the chance be of its escaping, if the velocity become
two thousand four hundred feet per second. No, the
cause is remote from that of Mr. Wilkinson&#8217;s supposition.
There is a want of force&mdash;an accelerative propellant
force&mdash;which should continue to the end of the
tube, be that length ever so great; and on this point, for
one, turns the whole future improvement of gunnery.</p>

<p>The result wished for can be obtained by a systematical
arrangement of the granulation of powder.
That a much greater velocity than is obtained in this
gun&mdash;at present the greatest in any piece of ordnance
in use, and possessing a longer range than has been
obtained by any power in Europe&mdash;may and will be
attained, I fearlessly assert. I have obtained a velocity
with an ounce ball nearly doubling this; and though,
as it will be argued, this may be too limited an experiment,
yet let us not forget that great results most
frequently spring from little causes. Large rivers owe
their origin to small springs, and if the same principle
by which we can penetrate a plate of iron half an inch
thick with an ounce of lead, be fearlessly and judiciously
carried through, we may (and no doubt we shall)
live to see projectiles thrown 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> miles. That this will
be difficult to accomplish I deny: no difficulty attends
it, provided the principles before explained are duly
carried out.</p>

<p>The great principle in a propellant force is so to
arrange it that you do not obtain too great a velocity
at the first move of the projectile; as no mass can be
forced from a state of rest to a rapid state of motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
without communicating to the gun a corresponding
motion, which will create a recoil: and the greater the
motion, the greater the recoil. If the explosive matter
merely expands for a brief period, and is burnt out
before the shot has reached midway the length of the
gun, the velocity there acquired will be reduced, by
the condensed column of air in the other half of the
barrel, to the velocity it possessed when only one
fourth the length of the whole from the breech; consequently
it would be advantageous to cut the gun in
two at the middle, as a greater force would be then
generated advantageously, than by the whole. But
if you so arrange the granulation of your powder
that it shall proceed into motion more gradually, a
rapidly increasing force of elastic fluid will continue
to be generated, until it reaches its greatest maximum
of velocity (which it should do just as the ball leaves
the muzzle) then you obtain with your means the
greatest result possible.</p>

<p>We believe that the generality of gunpowder used
by our Government is vastly inferior in strength to
some made by private makers; yet it is not advisable
to jump from one extreme to another. What is
wanted is the proper blending of the qualities; an
addition of a quantity of Harvey&#8217;s quick powder to a
charge, when it has driven the ball up three-fourths
of the tube of a gun, and probably had acquired a
velocity of 2,000 feet per second, might so aid it, that
it would leave the muzzle with a velocity of 3,000.</p>

<p>You cannot put a locomotive train in motion at
once: if it were attempted, you would break all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
carriages; but if you gradually add your force, you
gain in time the greatest possible velocity. I have
drawn a parallel case: it is the same with gunpowder;
only the velocities are widely different. Therefore,
I may be pardoned, if I say gunnery is like steam,
but in its infancy. Let us but clearly see and
understand aright the principle&mdash;knowing that the
greater momentum the less the action of the atmosphere&mdash;and
if 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> miles can be obtained with a ball
60 lbs. weight, 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> may be easily accomplished by a
ball of 120 lbs. Powder is made, and can be had, that
will do this.</p>

<p>The use of compound-shot has of late years become
quite common in experiments: why lead, with its
alloys, has not been more extensively used as a projectile
for large guns, has always appeared to me
extraordinary. Its weight and density peculiarly fit it
for this purpose, and its non-conducting principle is its
greatest recommendation. How is it? In no instance,
except as compound-shot, do we find any record of the
use of leaden bullets on a large scale, save in Sir
Howard Douglas&#8217;s &#8220;Naval Gunnery,&#8221; where, in a note,
he says, &#8220;A very distinguished naval commander
mentioned to me, that he knew a person who had
served in an American privateer, which, being out of
shot, and unable to procure a supply of iron balls,
used leaden shot as substitutes. This person always
mentioned with great surprise the superior effect of
leaden balls.&#8221; Well he might; for the reader need
not be told that its greater specific gravity would add
to its momentum, and a longer medium velocity be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
retained during its flight. But it possesses another
recommendation, superior to all these, in warfare:
that of communicating all its force, all its velocity, be
they ever so great, to the body struck. Iron does not
possess this quality; except to a certain extent, and that
at low velocities. Hence the cause of its being found
in naval warfare, that balls at low velocities damage
and destroy ships&#8217; sides more than at higher velocities,
even when passing quite through. Lead, in the act of
striking hard substances, iron or stone for instance, is
partially flattened, until the flat surface is nearly equal
to the diameter of the sphere of the ball; thus parting
with all the force it struck the object with, and in
most instances falling motionless at the base of the
object struck; while in the stone, the surrounding
crystals or grains are, by their abrasion on each other,
pounded into dust, in proportion to the size and force
of the body of lead striking them: in many instances to
many times the shot&#8217;s bulk, and only flattening the lead,
less or more, in proportion to the capability of the stone
to resist. Iron striking stone retains its shape: the
grains are driven back upon each other, and each
offering its proportion of elasticity, the ball is enabled
to rebound back; which it does in many instances to a
considerable percentage of the whole distance it had
been projected. The greater the velocity with which
an iron ball is projected the greater the rebound back
from a hard substance such as stone. Reversely,
the greater the velocity of lead, the greater its
effect on the object struck. Walls or fortifications
struck by leaden balls at the same velocities (waiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the advantage to lead by its greater specific gravity)
would be pounded into sand by less than two-thirds
the same number of lead as of iron shot. Any unprejudiced
person may soon satisfy himself of this, by
trying it with a musket or fowling piece. A leaden
ball will pound itself a hole many times its own bulk,
while an iron ball will not make a hole half its size.</p>

<p>I have tried many experiments to ascertain the
penetrating powers of iron and lead relatively, by
striking various objects, from a boiler plate of half an
inch thickness down to fir deals. The same size of
lead will, under certain circumstances, punch a perfect
hole in a plate of half-inch thickness, as I shall have
occasion to show; while, under precisely the same
arrangement, the iron ball would rebound back with
very little diminution of force; and if the plate of
iron be at a perfect right angle, the iron ball would
nearly return into the muzzle, of the gun. In truth, I
had a narrow escape seventeen years ago, from a bullet
actually cutting the rim of my hat: so that it will be
well, when experimenting in this way, to be sure that the
person is well esconced, for fear of unpleasant results.</p>

<p>Lead, therefore, for destroying ships, as well as stone
walls, is unquestionably highly advantageous; even if
projected with the same velocities as at present adopted
for iron. The additional weight would not decrease
the destructive effects; it would augment them. I
perfectly agree with the American <em class="ital">privateer</em>, that the
wonderfully destructive power of leaden cannon balls
will create surprise, whenever they shall come generally
into use. Imagine the effect from a gun of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dimensions of a 10-inch bore. It is dreadful to contemplate.</p>

<p>The effect of lead will be easily understood when
explained in the following way. If a 36 lb. shot have
a velocity of 2,000 feet per second, the force is equal
to the velocity multiplied by the weight, or 72,000 lbs.
The whole of this force would strike a wall, and be
left there, if communicated by soft lead; if by iron,
at the same velocity, it would be minus the amount of
force required to make it rebound to the great distance
to which iron invariably returns. Though created by
the elasticity of the iron itself, this must be deducted
from the effect produced, and hence arises the great
advantage the lead possesses. We are aware that
iron driven with a slight velocity rebounds less; true,
and less is its real effect; for under the very same
circumstances would the great advantages of the lead
predominate. It may be objected, that lead is too
easily misshaped; &#8220;pure it is, but with alloys not
so.&#8221; At low velocities it might, but the greater
velocities diminish that chance, as it is a well known
fact that all dense incompressible bodies are least
affected by an extremely sharp motion. All our
arrangements in warlike preparations, at present,
involve great weight of projectile for fracturing, not
perforating. During the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo,
2,159 rounds, of twenty-four and eighteen pounders,
were requisite to form the small breach of thirty feet
wide, and 6,478 rounds for the larger of 100 feet.
At Badajos there was expended, to form three breaches
of 40, 90, and 150 feet respectively, the enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
amount of 31,861 rounds of the same sized iron shot.
We may be pardoned if we presume to say, one-half
the number of lead shot would have done more, and
done it better.</p>

<p>If we bear in mind, that the whole round of experiments
from which Hutton drew his deductions, were
conducted with iron projectiles, the inconsistency of
taking his data as the standard will be apparent.
The dissimilitude of specific gravities being great,
namely, 7,425 and 11,327&mdash;or one-third difference&mdash;it
clearly shows, without any effort of the imagination,
that the range must be in the same proportion, with
the addition of greater momentum. For it will
scarcely be denied, that a ball of gold or platina, from
the same cause, will maintain a velocity longer, and
consequently range further, than even lead. Hutton&#8217;s
theory only establishes the principle, that the lighter
the body projected, the sooner it is acted upon by
atmospheric resistance, and a medium velocity induced.
We cannot attribute his preferring iron to arise from
an opinion of its penetrating to greater depths; for a
man of his extensive knowledge and research could
scarcely be guilty of such an error. But even in our
enlightened times we are told that elephants cannot
be killed with any projectile but steel: leaden balls
cannot do it. I should like to try, and receive the
<em class="ital">tusks</em> in return.</p>

<p>The shrapnell shell (invented by General Shrapnell),
or spherical case shot, introduced into the British
service of late years, is probably the most destructive
of any missile in use. It was intended to supersede&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
it has done&mdash;canister and grape shot; effecting
the same results at treble the range. The construction
and principle are very simple, being merely
a shell of an unusually light description; in fact,
little more than a light cast-iron hollow ball, with a
fuse hole. A certain quantity of leaden, or iron
bullets is put into it, and the interstices around the
ball shaken full of powder; a fuse of the length
required is inserted, and explodes the shell during its
flight: the peculiarity being, that the body of small
balls retain their medium velocity and travel on,
merely diverging, latterly, like an immense charge of
bird shot. They are usually fired from howitzers,
carronades, and other wide bored-guns, at or near
horizontal ranges. A considerable delay occurred
before they were successfully perfected. It was found
that when the small balls did not pack perfectly tight,
or were packed overtight, the case frequently exploded
in the gun: occasioned, no doubt, by the friction
creating a spark at the moment of the howitzer being
fired, and thus exploding the shell before its time;
but we believe such an occurrence rarely happens now,
from other improvements since adopted.</p>

<p>The preceding pages appeared in my last work
published in 1846. They are still so much in keeping
with the state of gunnery at the present day, and
so prophetic of what has, and is about to occur, that
they will be regarded, I trust, as bearing the stamp
of authority.</p>

<p>Progress, in its rapid advance, has made many
English guns objects for the furnace or the museum;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and many guns, which formerly ranked high as
useful and important weapons, have become things
of the past.</p>

<p>Monsters are now all the rage, with a range of
three miles, and artillerists contemplate extending the
range to double that distance; whilst the projectiles
used are not &#8220;pounders,&#8221; but approximating to tons.
So much for improvement. In political economy we
are told that improvement to be good must be
gradual; but only effect some slight improvement
in gunnery, make but one step in advance, and the
desire for further improvement then ranges at will,
and impossibilities are craved for and sought to be
attained.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago the success of Mr. Monck (certainly
the first modern improver of ordnance,) led
to the unlimited production of undigested plans for
changes in gunnery; but, unfortunately for the science,
no progress was made on the one great improvement
of Mr. Monck.</p>

<p>War found us ill prepared in the field, and out-weighted
&#8220;afloat,&#8221; so that almost as many men were
killed by the bursting of mortars, and other ill-constructed
guns, as by the fire of the enemy: so critical
was our situation, indeed, that but for the general
adoption in England&#8217;s army of my great invention,
the rifle on the expansive or &#8220;Greenerian&#8221; principle,
and its skilful use by our brave soldiers, the war
had gone against us. Our rifles were equal in range
to our artillery, and this saved us; whilst the enemy,
astonished at the effects produced by our bullets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
conscious of their inferiority both in the construction
and use of small arms, abandoned the contest: but no
doubt with a firm determination to profit by their
dear-bought experience.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that our artillery was
never so effective as that of the enemy, and that more
is due to the patient and enduring bravery of the
British soldier than to our field-pieces and heavy
ordnance. That England&#8217;s artillery was at this time
most disgracefully inefficient, it would be folly to deny.
The larger guns were destroyed in an inconceivably
short space of time. After five, ten, or fifteen rounds
were fired the guns burst, killing the gunners in great
numbers.</p>

<p>The readers of my works are already familiar with
my opinions on this subject, and their value will now
be enhanced by the fact that they have been proved
to be the opinions of a &#8220;practical man.&#8221; Success in
the improvement of small arms is a sure encouragement
to those anxious for the advancement of projectile
science, and it is a coat of mail in which to fight
against the prejudices and incompetency of official
management.</p>

<p>Who, on reading my work of 1841, believed the
prediction I therein made, that small arms would be
produced which would render field guns useless?
The fact is, however, firmly established, that the
best rifles on my principle will out-range by several
hundred yards the best &#8220;six-pounder&#8221; in her
Majesty&#8217;s service; and that, too, with a repetition
of fire wonderfully quick and effective: as the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in the Crimea can testify, on more than one
occasion.</p>

<p>To endeavour to point out that an improvement
may be effected in artillery equal to that which has
been effected in small arms, is the object of the
following pages.</p>

<p>The author asks a dispassionate perusal and careful
study of his work, in justice to himself and to
the importance of the subject. Judging of future
probabilities by what has already been accomplished,
the reader will be prepared for what follows. That
great and important changes must take place in artillery
cannot be doubted, and should England refuse to
avail herself of the improvements to be effected, other
nations, and amongst them our late opponent, will be
the first to seize and adopt them. In former works
I have asked the indulgence of my military readers on
account of my scanty military knowledge; but professional
men appear to be equally in the dark with the
uninitiated: indeed, the lamentable shortcomings of
the English artillerists have placed them in the rank
of mere &#8220;waiters upon providence&#8221; for the next step
towards improvement. The present time is decidedly
propitious; let improvements now be made, and we
may surely hope that they will be appreciated by the
public, if not by the Government authorities.</p>

<p>What is the best metal for cannon? is a question
which has often been asked, and the answers have
been very conflicting. Some have advocated mixtures
of copper and tin; others have advocated cast iron,
and more recently wrought iron; still more recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
steel, and, lastly, cast steel, have had their advocates.
Arguments as plentiful as summer flowers
have been advanced in favour of each, and the argument
has been carried on with a vast amount of
prejudice and warmth, according to the degree of
acquaintance with or attachment to the favourite
metal of each individual. It is rare to meet with a
mind free from bias, equally well acquainted with the
merits of the several metals, and their application to
the purposes intended. Still more rare is it to meet
with a mind possessing all this metallurgic knowledge,
and combining with it an intimate acquaintance
with the principles of projectiles, as well as a scientific
knowledge of the construction of the engine (the
perfection of which consists in its having no points
which are weak or unnecessarily strong); and yet it
is by such a combination of knowledge and the application
of these principles that we must be guided, if
we would be successful in the accumulation of projectile
power. In the present age we are really alive
to the advantage of &#8220;playing at long bowls;&#8221; and the
question now to be determined is, what is the greatest
weight of shot and shell we can throw, and how
many miles can we project it. The Americans were
undoubtedly the first to discover the great advantage
of this question with their lesser frigates; the late war
has developed it still more; and it now remains to
be ascertained how much further can we go. For on
this important point the superior efficacy of artillery
depends.</p>

<p>At St. Sebastian, in 1813, cast-iron guns threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
tons of shot at a range of 1,500 yards; some particular
guns firing as many as 3,000 rounds, and yet it is
more than probable that had the same guns been used
in the Crimea, they would have burst with one-fourth
the number of rounds. Experience proves that it is
not the great number of rounds fired which strains
and destroys the gun, but the high elevation at which
these guns are placed, in order to get range; this it
is which shakes and disintegrates the crystalline
structure of the metal, and thus extreme range is
obtained at extreme cost. A gun which at 6&deg; of
elevation could stand without a strain 200 rounds,
would be likely at an elevation of 30&deg; to burst before
50 rounds were fired. The explanation of this is
sufficiently simple. A gun fired at 6&deg; recoils as the
projectile is projected forward, in proportion to its
relative weight and friction; but when brought up to
an elevation above 30&deg; the gun is entirely out of the
horizontal, and cannot recoil as it does at an elevation
of 6&deg;: the force is now exerted downward, and the
gun impinges on its support&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, either upon its bed
on the deck of the ship, or on the solid earth of the
battery, which is comparatively immovable; thus the
force which displaced the gun in the first instance is
now exerted on the sides of the gun, and the projectile
receiving additional force is projected further.
But this increased range is obtained at the expense of
the gun, which is rapidly destroyed: 50 rounds being
sufficient to render it unfit for service. To obviate
this rapid destruction of cannon, the metal has been
changed from the molecular to the fibrous; that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
from cast iron to wrought iron. One object of this
chapter is to point out the difficulties which arise
in determining what the best metal for cannon really
is, and to show the advantages to be gained by
attending to the proper construction of projectile
engines, without attaching undue importance to the
<em class="ital">material</em> of which they are made.</p>

<p>Before rejecting cast iron as useless for the construction
of large guns, it would be well to assure
ourselves that no better quality of metal can be
produced than that which is at present manufactured.
We must also satisfy ourselves that we have clearly
understood the proper shape and form of cannon to
resist concussions. These concussions, be it remembered,
were more violent in the late than in any previous
war; and it is an undoubted fact that we had many
more fractures then than on any previous occasion:
first, on account of the strain produced by the great
elevation required to get increased range; and,
secondly, on account of the imperfect shape of the gun.
The average number of rounds fired from the 13-inch
mortars which burst at the bombardment of Sweaborg
was 120, and the fracture in all was peculiarly alike;
being at right angles to the supports. Now, that this
is due to the form of the gun cannot be doubted; and it
will be shown more fully in a subsequent page.</p>

<p>But there is another cause to which I wish now to
direct attention, viz., the jamming of the Lancaster
shell, which takes place in the increasing spiral of the
oval gun at the very point where the projectile acquires
a proportional increase of velocity. The effect of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
may be illustrated by running a locomotive at its
maximum of speed over an increasing curve in the
railroad, with the certainty of landing it in an adjoining
ditch. The principle which determines the result is
quite immutable: viz., that matter in rapid motion
cannot be materially affected by any force inferior
to the primary force: the tendency of the body being
to go straight forward; whereas a slow train goes
round a curve with the greatest ease. Two motions
can easily be given to matter in a lower velocity; but
not so easily when the velocity is much increased.
Hence I fear that the inventor of the Lancaster gun
must have had a misconception of the true laws of
motion; for by increasing the degree of spiral at the
muzzle, instead of at the breech of the gun, he has
rendered nearly useless what would otherwise have
proved a most formidable engine of war.</p>

<p>From these observations it may, I think, fairly be
doubted whether the bursting of cannon is owing
entirely to the inferior quality of the cast iron used
in their formation; though there can, I think, be no
doubt that English cast iron is not only much inferior
to what it formerly was, but that it is also inferior to
that which is now manufactured in Russia. Why it
is so will be subsequently explained.</p>

<p>These defects in cast iron have naturally led to many
attempts to substitute for it a more durable metal;
and in most cases the metal selected has been wrought
iron. Wrought iron has been used, not only in solid
cannon, but in the original &#8220;hoop and stave:&#8221; &#8220;staves
outside,&#8221; and &#8220;staves inside,&#8221; as in Mr. Malle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>t&#8217;s
monster mortar. Forms of gun as numerous as can
be conceived have been constructed, only to prove
themselves in every case most complete failures. Our
friends at the Mersey Works, Liverpool, will, no
doubt, demur to this assertion; as &#8220;all creations of
the mind appear most perfect to the father of the
thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>Great credit is, however, due to the enterprise
and energy displayed by the inventors, forgers, and
finishers of this great gun; which has been the
wonder of many minds in this age of wonders: and
it is a highly important invention, as showing what
we, as a people, are capable of producing by our
mechanical and engineering skill. But here, in my
estimation, the wonder ceases; for so sure as there
is any truth in the Scotch proverb, &#8220;A silk purse
cannot be made out of a sow&#8217;s lug,&#8221; so surely is it
true that no man, however great his genius and
working powers, can make a good cannon of wrought
iron. When the hardness and ductility of silver can be
imparted to and held by lead, then will it be possible
to make wrought iron accomplish all the purposes
required of a good cannon.</p>

<p>In vain may Mr. Horsfall urge that his gun has
never been burst. Why? Simply because it has
not yet been subjected to the same amount of pressure
on the square inch; neither has it been tested
at the same elevation as some other 10-inch guns,
which, in proportion to their size have stood a more
severe test. It is a fact, which may be clearly
demonstrated, that if a 10-inch gun of 95 cwt. be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fired at an elevation of 40&deg; with 17 lbs. of gunpowder,
then a gun of more than six times that weight would
not be overloaded if its due proportion of powder
were about 100 lbs. Has this gun been fired with
one half of this? Until it has been satisfactorily
proved to this extent, we feel sure that the authorities
are justified in not considering Mr. Horsfall&#8217;s a
successful achievement.</p>

<p>Whatever may be Mr. Horsfall&#8217;s impression with
regard to the advantages of wrought iron for making
cannon, I am satisfied, after a long and careful study
of the results of all its varieties, from the most
ordinary to the most perfect combination that has
been manufactured&mdash;either for tenacity, tenuity, or
resistance of lateral pressures&mdash;that it cannot answer
in large guns.</p>

<p>This I think any one will admit, after considering
the two following facts; which apply equally to all
varieties and mixtures of wrought iron.</p>

<p>1. The strength of iron is at its maximum in the
smallest mechanical structures.</p>

<p>2. The quality of the metal is improved as it is
subjected to greater pressure and condensation.</p>

<p>The extent to which this improvement may be
carried has never yet been ascertained; every fresh
manipulation improves its quality. The tenacity of
wrought iron is best displayed in a wire, drawn out until
it is not thicker than a human hair. Large masses
of wrought iron are weak and spongy in geometrical
progression with the mass, and the crystalline or
molecular form increases with the mass. If large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
forgings are carefully examined, crystals will be found
whose facets would produce inches of surface; as was
clearly demonstrated by the bursting of a 10-inch
gun at Woolwich: made, if we mistake not, by Mr.
Nasmyth.</p>

<p>Another very important cause which renders large
masses of wrought iron unsound (and which was
fatal in Mr. Nasmyth&#8217;s gun) is the impossibility of
condensing tons of wrought iron equally all through
the mass. No one has yet been able to overcome
this difficulty.</p>

<p>When the force of a blow, however great, is exerted
on the surface of a mass of metal, its effect is neutralized
within a few inches of the surface; condensation
takes place in inverse ratio from the point of
impact, and thus the effect is limited. The force
which produces this condensation tends also to
elongate the fibres of the metal. This elongation
is greatest in the immediate vicinity of the force;
the fibres in the interior of the mass are less
elongated therefore than on the exterior; and the
fibres in the interior of the mass being less ductile
(from the cause already explained) than those on the
exterior, the interior of the mass elongates, by disintegration
of its fibres or crystals, and a porous open
mass is thus produced, surrounded by a fibrous case.
Instances of this are to be seen in broken engine-shafts
and anchors; and, indeed, in all large masses of
wrought iron, whether fractured by design or accident.</p>

<p>Another cause of this defect in large masses of
wrought iron, is the long continued heat to which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
is necessary to expose such large forgings. The iron
expands as it is heated, but it does not expand
equally all through the mass; and the result of this
is that the interior becomes porous and spongy: an
appearance which must have been observed by every
one who has operated upon large masses.</p>

<p>The shaft of the <i>Leviathan</i> weighs 26 tons; but,
instead of resisting twenty-six times the pressure of
a shaft one ton in weight, it will, from the causes
already mentioned, be found unequal to half that
amount.</p>

<p>We have watched with much interest the forging
of these immense shafts; and the difficulties attending
the forging of this structure prove the accuracy
of our reasoning on the strength of large masses of
wrought iron. The weight of the shaft when finished
is 26 tons, and the waste during the process of
welding amounts to 74 or 75 tons.</p>

<p>The present shaft is the third which has been
manufactured; the two first having proved notorious
failures: thus 200 tons of iron have been wasted;
which we think is sufficient proof either of the
unfitness of the material, or of imperfection in the
method of construction. Moreover, I fear that when
the vessel encounters a rolling sea, the sudden check
and strain produced by the total immersion of one
paddle-wheel and the freedom of the other, will subject
the present shaft to a strain which will affect its
duration; and a vessel costing nearly a million of
money may thus be left to reach her port with crippled
powers of propulsion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Where, it may be asked, is the skill in devising
engines more powerful than the ingenuity of man can
beneficially work out? This has indeed been done in
the case of the <i>Leviathan</i>; a monster vessel has been
built, but all the engineering skill expended upon it
has as yet been insufficient to bring it to perfection.</p>

<p>The skill hitherto displayed in welding large
forgings of wrought iron into shafts, or other large
masses, has been of a very low order; much more
may be done than has yet been accomplished, if men
will only set about it in a scientific manner. The
present mode of proceeding is to build a structure of
iron much as a builder would raise a structure of
bricks; large and small pieces being mixed together
until the requisite mass is obtained.</p>

<p>Now, a much simpler method, and one which we
have tried on several occasions, is first to construct
several segments of iron of the requisite length, and
of dimensions equivalent to the intended object; each
segment being fitted to fill its place amongst a given
number of other segments (whether twenty, forty, or
fifty segments be required,) so as to form a complete
cylinder; as the <a href="#Fig5">wood-cut</a> will fully explain:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a>
<img src="images/illo112.png" alt="New method of casting a hollow axle" width="350" height="181" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>In welding this structure, the heat is equally
diffused all through the mass; and thus the great
evil of unequal expansion and contraction is avoided.
When the steam hammer is brought into play, its
face is a &#8220;swage&#8221; of circular form, calculated to clasp a
large portion of the upper part, whilst a corresponding
space is formed in the anvil; and by gradually turning
the shaft, the whole is forged into a perfect round.
The peculiar advantage gained by this mode of proceeding,
is not only the facility with which heat is diffused
through the mass, but that each segment is made
to act like a wedge on its neighbour; thus producing
the most solid forging that has yet been attained.
This is rendered still more perfect, both as regards
strength and durability, from the fact that a hollow
axle has been produced; the great advantages of
which it would be out of place to dilate upon in this
work.</p>

<p>We trust that these anticipated misfortunes may be
avoided by the construction of a more perfect shaft;
and that, not only for the sake of the shareholders,
but for the credit of the engineer who devised this
great vessel&mdash;deservedly one of the wonders of the
world. A spare shaft would be profitable ballast, if
of no more value to the <i>Leviathan</i>.</p>

<p>Rolled railway-carriage axles were constructed for
me with perfect success on this principle nearly twenty
years ago, at the Walker Iron Works, near Newcastle-on-Tyne.
The idea has, however, been in a
measure &#8220;shelved;&#8221; but necessity will bring it into
use again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The only engineer who has, by practical experience,
satisfied himself that large masses of wrought iron
are totally useless for making heavy ordnance is Mr.
Nasmyth; whose monster cannon, which was to
astonish the whole world, proved, when heated, to
have so little cohesion that it would scarcely hold
together whilst being lifted from the furnace to the
anvil. And, to his credit be it said, Mr. Nasmyth,
seeing that wrought iron would not answer the
purpose, manfully gave up his hopeless task. Similar
experience would probably make some of our present
engineers wiser men.</p>

<p>My experience in manufacturing the largest
wrought iron guns which it is prudent to construct,
sufficiently proves the truth of these assertions.</p>

<p>Harpoon gun-barrels, one inch and a half in the
bore, having the metal at the breech end an inch
and a quarter thick, will stand a proof which
invariably bursts a thicker barrel; in fact, all experience
tends to show that light wrought iron or
steel barrels are stronger than unusually heavy ones.
As all depends on the principle of condensing the
fibres of the iron, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ceteris paribus</i>, the greater the
condensation the greater the strength, and the
less the condensation the greater the weakness.</p>

<p>That this argument applies principally to solid
forged guns I am ready to admit; and that guns
forged of hoops, rings, and bars, in smaller sections,
are free from this objection, I am also ready to
admit. These guns are, however, liable to objections
equally fatal, both as regards their enduring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
projective powers, as I shall presently show. Experience
proves that brass guns are inferior, both in
sharpness of shooting and in range, to cast-iron guns:
this is undoubtedly attributable to the greater softness
of brass than of cast iron; and for the same reason a
wrought-iron gun, though made as sound as one of
cast iron, would be inferior in these two important
points. But when a wrought-iron gun is composed
of many particles imperfectly secured (and no
mechanical force is sufficient to secure perfect
cohesion in large masses), the wrought becomes
doubly inferior to the cast gun: a shot projected
from such a gun starts from an unsound base; a
large portion of the explosive force is absorbed by the
variety of sections composing the gun, to the injury
both of the accuracy and length of range of the projectile.
The softer metals cannot be beneficially used
in the construction of large guns, because they destroy
the force of the expellant without making any equivalent
return; and the softer the metal and the greater
its substance, the more clearly is this important fact
demonstrated. Thus, in experiments made with large
cannon for increasing the weight of the gun beyond
a certain proportion to that of the projectile, a gun
of ten tons weight and ten inch bore would not
exceed in range a gun of five tons, if the charge of
powder were the same; on account of the indisputable
fact that much more force of the expellant is destroyed,
whilst more than double the force is absorbed for the
recoil of the ten ton than of the five ton gun; and
the loss from these two causes must materially affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the flight of the projectile, though fired at exactly the
same elevation.</p>

<p>The great defect which experiment shows to exist
in the hoop-and-stave wrought iron gun, and which
renders the gun self-destroying, is separation at
points between the trunnions and cascable of the gun.
The force acting first upon the breech, it yields, and
the force is then brought to bear upon the longitudinal
portion of the gun behind the trunnions; the staves
have thus to bear the first strain, and, after a few
shots, become elongated. An opening of the hoops
at their junction with each other (most frequently
between the breech and trunnions) begins, after a
very few shots, to be distinctly visible, and increases
at every discharge, until further proceeding amounts
to madness, or recklessness of human life.</p>

<p>That enormous engine, Mallet&#8217;s monster mortar, of
which I give an <a href="#Fig6">engraving</a> on <a href="#Page_100">page 100</a>, clearly proves
this to be the case. It will be observed to be constructed
with a solid cast iron breech end, the dimensions of
which will be seen by referring to the engraving. Abutting
upon this are a succession of wrought iron hoops,
ingeniously inserted into each other, and more firmly
secured by six outside staves of great dimensions,
which, at the muzzle ring, pass through openings in
the muzzle ring, with heads like enormous rivets.
The binding power is given by &#8220;quoin-like&#8221; wedges,
driven through the opposite end of the stave, beneath
the projection of the cast breech, giving power to
tighten the longitudinal binders by a blow when
required.</p>

<p>This is notorious as a monster failure, even with a
charge of powder amounting to only one half what the
projector fondly hoped would be perfectly harmless
in its effects. This Brobdignagian toy has proved to
be fearfully expensive, the cost having been estimated
at eight thousand pounds. It has, I believe, been
the largest and most expensive experiment indulged
in by the noble &#8220;projector,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and I sincerely hope

<p>The preceding pages will have done much to remove
from an unbiassed mind any favourable impression of
the advantages expected to result from the use of
wrought-iron cannon. The knowledge of this subject,
even among talented and scientific men, appears to be
at a very low ebb, as is evinced by the multitude of
failures that have taken place; not one success of
any moment has as yet been attained, and not a
discovery has been made worthy of being chronicled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having enlarged thus much on the qualities of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
metal which it is certain can never supersede the use
of cast-iron, even though it be freed from the defects
found practically to exist in our present constructed
iron artillery; and having also alluded to the fact that
the <em class="ital">form</em> has much influence on the durability of
cast-iron guns, I now proceed to the more important
point of the qualities of cast-iron itself.</p>

<p>Little doubt exists that guns cast a hundred years
ago were more durable than those of more recent
formation; it is evident, therefore, that apart from
mere form, some material depreciation must have
taken place in the quality of the metal. The use
of hot blast-furnaces, better fluxes, and improved
chemical knowledge in the reduction of metallic
ores, though highly profitable in a commercial point
of view, doubling the products of our mines,
and enriching their proprietors, has, unfortunately
rendered English cast-iron perfectly unfit for the
formation of cannon, if increased range and greater
strain by high elevation are to be the order of the
day.</p>

<p>The durability of Russian cast-iron is unquestionably
greater than that manufactured in England.
Some cause must exist for this; and the question
arises, is the ore superior to ours, or does the
superiority of Russian iron depend on their method
of smelting? The latter is, we believe, the cause of
the superiority of Russian iron; for experiments show
that Russian ore, smelted in an English furnace,
yields the same kind of cast-iron as is produced from
the ore found in England. The inference, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is plain, that the difference in the process of
smelting makes all the difference in the quality of
the iron.</p>

<p>Two thousand years ago the Romans, or their
dependents, smelted iron in the county of Durham:
vast accumulations of slag exist there at the present
time; and thousands of tons have been beneficially
re-smelted by two adjoining iron-works, and a percentage
of iron obtained sufficient to prove that the
Romans were little indebted to fluxes or hot blasts
for the quality of iron they obtained. The Russians
cannot boast of these adjuncts any more than the
Romans: the old agents, wood and energy, are alone
employed in the smelting of their ores; and in the
absence of scientific aids, though they obtain a much
smaller aggregate quantity of metal, yet it is
undoubtedly of a much superior quality. With the
Romans, also, the yield was meagre, but the quality
was good; now, however, circumstances are reversed,
quantity, not quality, being the order of the day.</p>

<p>The use of coals instead of wood in the process of
smelting has introduced a mixture which is very
prejudicial. Most of the coal, even from our very
best mines, contains a large quantity of pyrites, or
bisulphuret of iron, which, combining with the cast-iron,
injures it to an incalculable extent.</p>

<p>These facts fully explain why our cast-iron guns
are not so good now as formerly. Select the most
suitable mine in the kingdom, erect a furnace on the
most improved principles, employ wood fuel only, avoid
fluxes and hot and cold blasts, and be content with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the small amount of metal produced, and beyond all
doubt the quality will be all that the most sanguine
founder or artillerist could wish.</p>

<p>Thus the inferiority of our cast-iron guns has been
accounted for, and a method suggested, which, if
efficiently carried out, would effect the desired
improvement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are indebted to Krupp for the first suggestion
of, as well as the first attempt to introduce, a cast
steel gun of greater durability and power than the
best cast-iron gun which has yet been manufactured.
Steel, possessing, as it does, hardness to any desired
extent, ductility in an equal degree, tenacity unrivalled,
and all the other requisites, is destined to
take the place of all other metals in the construction
of artillery. This metal waits only to be tested;
and the greater the extent to which the trial is
carried, the more confident we are that it will answer
every purpose.</p>

<p>Krupp, like many other men with valuable ideas,
has been peculiarly unfortunate in his attempts to
carry them out. With a vast amount of knowledge
of the science of metallurgy, he wants more knowledge
in the not inferior science of projectiles; the
most important point being to ascertain the form of
gun calculated to be suitable for new metal, of the
use of which, for cannon, the world possesses no antecedent
knowledge.</p>

<p>The only failures Mr. Krupp has made (if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
can, strictly speaking, be so called), have arisen from
mal-construction, imperfect form, and unscientific
combinations; defects which might be expected from
a mere novice, though not from experienced artillerists
or founders of artillery. The trial of the only steel
gun sent by Mr. Krupp to this country, was conducted
in the most absurd manner, and on wholly
unscientific principles. I will endeavour to convey
some idea of this most extraordinary of experiments.
Whether Mr. Krupp was unacquainted with the
durability of his metal, or was persuaded, against his
will, to conduct the experiment as he did, I know
not, but the following is what took place:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 1851 Mr. Krupp brought to Woolwich a
specimen steel gun of ten-inch bore, weighing about
four tons. He was induced (but why, I am at a loss
to conceive,) to construct a cast-iron jacket, or outer
gun, into which his steel gun was inserted up to the
trunnions. The steel gun was separated from its
cast-iron jacket by a space of half an inch in its
whole length, except at each end, where the jacket
was fitted to the gun with a moderate degree of
tightness; thus the gun and jacket consisted of two
tubes, one within the other, fastened only at their
extremities, and that by a very slight force. The
result, as might have been expected, was the bursting
both of the gun and its case; but that the steel gun
or its jacket would have stood the test, if subjected
to it singly, cannot be doubted. The difference of
expansion between the steel gun and its jacket would
be quite enough to account for its bursting. Had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
contact of the two been perfect throughout the whole
length, but allowing half an inch all around for the
expansion of the steel gun in that part which was
subjected to the greatest pressure, the very act of
restraining it in other parts so as to prevent equal expansion,
would be perfectly certain to produce a fracture.
Mr. Krupp&#8217;s friends have complained loudly of unfair
treatment, whether justly or not, no opinion need now
be given; but it is much to be regretted that his
experiment was not carried out on scientific principles.
The introduction of cast steel guns will be the most
essential improvement in artillery: and an extensive
series of experiments, extending over many years,
during which time I have manufactured gun-barrels
of steel alone, ought to give my opinion some weight
on this subject.</p>

<p>Laminated steel gun-barrels were well known in
1851; but the English bugbear, prejudice, raised a
clamour against them, which was echoed by interest
and ignorance, and thus their general adoption was
for a long time prevented. However, in the short
space of seven years, they have become universally
adopted, with the most beneficial results; better
shooting, less annoyance from recoil, less weight to
carry, and greater safety to the sportsman, being the
principal. And so it will be with steel cannon;
as a short time will suffice to enable scientific investigation
to remove all prejudices against them.</p>

<p>The external form of cannon is a question of
vital importance, but one which is little understood
by artillerists of the present day. Whilst it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
demonstrable fact that all excessive bulk of cast-iron
causes weakness in proportion to the excess,
no effectual steps have as yet been taken by the
Government to ascertain what is the due proportion
of metal which ought to exist in different parts of
the gun. The American authority on naval gunnery,
Captain Dhalgren, has paid considerable attention
to this subject; and if the reports on the durability
of American heavy ordnance can be relied on (and
there is no reason why they should not) his investigations
have been attended with much success.</p>

<p>Captain Dhalgren has extended the principle acted
upon many years ago by Mr. Monck; his great
improvement consisting in lessening the weight of
iron in front of the trunnions, and adding to that
of the breech. In cannon, as in fowling-pieces,
weight in the fore part is useless; conducing neither
to the safety of the gun, nor to the smartness of
its shooting. For endurance, it is necessary that
the expansion should be equal in every part of the
gun; rigidity in one part increasing the strain on
the immediately adjacent parts, which, if much reduced,
are thus rendered liable to fracture. The
breech has to endure the lengthened explosion produced
by the burning of the gunpowder; and, as
this continues until it has overcome the inertia of
the projectile, it is necessary in all cases that the
maximum of strength should be in the breech of
the gun. When the projectile is once in motion
the strength of the tube may be rapidly decreased;
the only strain it has to bear is exerted whilst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
projectile is passing over it; and this strain, in
properly constructed guns, becomes of shorter and
shorter duration as the projectile attains its highest
velocity at the muzzle of the gun. The greatest strain
a gun has to bear near the muzzle is that produced
by the condensation of the column of air in front
of the charge; and in almost every form of English
ordnance the weight of metal here is greater than
is necessary.</p>

<p>The Russian guns which have been brought to
this country present the same superabundance of
metal at the muzzle, whilst at the breech there
appears to be a deficiency; and when we take into
consideration the extraordinary reports of their endurance,
we must ascribe it to some other cause
than the proper distribution of metal. Their endurance
is no doubt owing in part to the goodness
of the metal, in part also to the form of the breech,
to the uniformity of thickness in the sides of the arch,
and, lastly, to the absence of those protuberances
called &#8220;reinforce rings.&#8221; These rings might with
propriety be termed &#8220;rings of destruction;&#8221; for
wherever irregularities exist in the substance of the
metal, there the waves of vibration are interrupted,
and the weak point then becomes fractured. The
science of spring-making in all its varieties demonstrates
the truth of this statement. Leave on a
coach-spring an abutment of metal like a &#8220;reinforce
ring,&#8221; and a few motions will be sufficient to break
it, however well the spring may be constructed in
every other part. The rigidity of this protuberance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
by interrupting the waves of vibration, causes additional
vibration in the adjacent and more yielding
part, and thus produces fracture. The same thing
occurs in all ill-constructed artillery: where the
vibrations are checked, there is always a danger of
some weaker part giving way. But the laws which
regulate the distribution of vibrations in metal
substances are not yet understood by artillerists,
or cannon would be differently constructed. Those
unscientific protuberances called &#8220;trunnions,&#8221; which
are to be seen in almost every description of
gun, prove the accuracy of my assertions. These
protuberances, if scientifically considered, would soon
be discarded, since they tend not only to the rapid
destruction of the cannon, but also exert a most
injurious influence on the direction of the projectile.
The most wonderful shooting ever heard of (and
which has been before alluded to) is partly to be
attributed to the absence of trunnions. Trunnions
act as the fulcrum of a scale-beam; they allow
the breech and muzzle of the gun to oscillate, but
in an opposite direction to a scale beam. Rifled
cannon can never be correctly constructed whilst
any weight impinges on the gun in front of the
first starting point of the projectile; they must
have the fulcrum behind the point of discharge, and
the more nearly in a direct line the better.</p>

<p>Rifled cannon will in some few years be perfectly
constructed of cast steel; the projectile being made of
gun metal, <i>i. e.</i>, ninety-five parts of copper to five
parts of tin, or of lead and its alloys, and at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
probable cost of ten times that of a cast-iron projectile
of equal weight.</p>

<p>Rifled cannon must be elevated by raising the
muzzle; no depression of the breech must occur as
by the usual elevating screw; and the recoil must be
received and borne by fastenings and axle in rear of
the breech only. Trunnions and all impinging influences
are incompatible with correctness of fire. The
muzzle must be raised in a similar manner to the raising
of a hand rifle, the recoil being thrown backwards, in
as direct a line as possible with that of the shot.</p>

<p>It is only on account of the difficulty of experimenting
with rifled cannon that they are at all behind
rifled muskets in point of perfection. The ardent
lover of science is appalled when an experiment costs
hundreds of pounds. We have not a General Jacob
everywhere who can afford to spend a thousand or
two in experiments; but, nevertheless, the lover of
science, could he experiment, might attain such
extraordinary accuracy of range, as to blow up a
smaller magazine than that of Kurrachee at four times
the distance; and that, too, with a more certain effect,
though with a projectile heavier than several of
Jacob&#8217;s rifles tied together. Correct direction is
certain in proportion to the increase of weight;
deflection being in the minimum with the heavier
weight, from the well known law of momentum.
That astute and energetic sovereign, the Emperor
Napoleon, is pursuing experiments with rifled cannon;
with what result there can be little doubt.</p>

<p>It must be by the use of rifled cannon that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
artillery will regain the place it has lost. A short
time will suffice to make the disparity between our
artillery and small arms as great as when we were
content with the six-pounder field gun and old &#8220;Brown
Bess.&#8221; Ranges will only be ruled by sight, and objects
will be hit eventually with as much ease at 5,000 yards
as they now are at 1,000. Steel, rifled cannon, and
projectiles of gun-metal will assuredly bring about as
complete a revolution in artillery as the Greenerian
rifle and bullet have effected in small arms.</p>

<p>The form of gun best suited for all purposes has yet
to be determined; and we have pointed out these defects
in our artillery with the hope that some of the great
practical philosophers of the present age may devote
themselves to the study of this question. It is nearly
allied to the science of bell-making, and a few more
fractures of Big Ben will extend our knowledge of
the subject, and produce a remedy which lies not very
deep below the surface. The laws which should
guide us in the construction of cast steel guns, so as
to insure their durability, are very analogous to those
which determine the durability of bells; for the laws
which regulate disintegration of crystalline structures
are very similar. Hitherto the rule of thumb has,
unfortunately, been the only rule observed in measuring
out the quantity of metal which shall surround
that portion of a cannon which has to sustain the most
violent concussion.</p>

<p>Professor Barlow many years ago proved, to the
satisfaction of the Institution of Civil Engineers, that
the metal in any cylinder decreases in utility in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to the square of its distance from the centre:
that the outside of a gun of the form now used, in
fact, is only one-ninth as useful as the inside; being
three times as far from the centre. If we double the
thickness, the outside, being five times as far from the
centre as the inside, will be but one-twenty-fifth as
useful; or in plain English, nearly useless. The
reason of this is simple, and I will endeavour to
explain it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bar of cast iron one inch thick each way and
40 inches long will stretch about one-twentieth of an
inch, if a weight of about four tons be suspended by it.
When the weight is removed, the cast iron nearly
recovers its previous form, and is uninjured; but if it
be stretched more, by a greater weight, it is permanently
injured.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bar of the same thickness, but three times as
long&mdash;120 inches&mdash;will stretch three times as much,
or three-twentieths of an inch, with the same weight;
or if only one-third the weight&mdash;one ton and a third&mdash;be
suspended, it will stretch one-twentieth of an
inch, the same as the shorter bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we suspend 16 tons by four bars, one inch
thick and 40 inches long, they will each stretch
one-twentieth of an inch only, and remain uninjured;
but if we attempt to do so with two bars 40 inches
long and two 120 inches long, then, when the whole
have lengthened one-twentieth of an inch, the short
ones are exerting a force of eight tons, but the long
ones that of only two and two-thirds tons. The weight,
therefore, will still further lengthen the bars, and permanently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
injure the short ones; perhaps break them
first, and then the long ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the way a gun is burst. The inside is a
series of bars of iron, say 40 inches long, in the form
of a ring; the outside a series of rings, representing
the bars three times as long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Warfare, since the first introduction of gunnery
into Europe, has been like one continued series of
experiments for testing the efficacy of our guns. No
description of gun we now possess can lay any claim
to existence fifty years ago: the great majority of our
guns now in use are of a much more recent date.</p>

<p>With one or two exceptions, no artillery has been
constructed on any scientific theory; some alteration
has been made, and if a gun of a certain form and
dimensions gave a certain result, then an extension or
emulation of that gun was tried; and if it succeeded
a loud cry of exultation was raised, and the discovery
was announced to the world as a great improvement.</p>

<p>Colonel Prejudice has invented a vastly improved
description of gun; another guess is made, and so
different forms of guns are multiplied. Can there
be a more striking illustration of this than the one
which took place during the late Crimean war? It
was boasted that the whole human race might be
exterminated by the new invention; but the &#8220;Lancaster
gun&#8221; turned out to be most unscientific in its construction,
and most eccentric in its action. Had such a
thing as scientific knowledge in gunnery existed among
the artillerists of the day, such a monstrosity would
have been buried soon after its birth; instead of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a><br /><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
allowed to squander large sums of money at every
discharge, and then at last to become a &#8220;Whistling
Jemmy&#8221; for our bluejackets to laugh at.</p>

<p>The form of cannon no doubt exercises a vital
influence over their durability; bad form and imperfection
of material combined, tended to produce
the rapid destruction of our guns during the late
important struggle.</p>

<p>The gun which has been experimented with to the
greatest extent, and which has withstood all trials successfully,
is a Russian fifty-six-pounder; taken, I believe,
at Bomarsund. In this gun there are two great peculiarities;
the shape, as will be seen in the <a href="#Fig7">diagram</a>,
differs from all our own guns: it is a &#8220;chambered
gun,&#8221; and the metal is taken away from the outside
precisely as the contraction increases on the inside
thus giving an equal thickness of metal in every part,
of the arc (see page 114).</p>

<p>In contrast with this, we give <a href="#Fig8">a cut</a> of our 8-inch
gun, which most nearly resembles it as a chambered
gun (see page 114).</p>

<p>The reader&#8217;s attention is especially directed to the
dissimilarity in the distribution of the metal in the
two guns. The want of uniform thickness of metal
in our 8-inch gun must be sufficient to convince any
one that, if the Russian gun be properly constructed,
the principle of ours must be radically wrong. That
such is the case, indeed, I cannot doubt, the Russian
gun having undergone such a test as would have
destroyed six of ours. The gun has since been made
two inches larger in the bore, and even oval-bored, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
firing shells, which should alone be enough to destroy
it; and yet with all this the gun remains perfect.</p>

<p>The gun which most nearly resembles this is our
English carronade; and that these guns have some
important principle in their shape is proved by their
great durability under all trials; and I believe that
the tests to which the carronade has been subjected
have been more severe than that of any other piece in
the British service.</p>

<p>There have been many shrewd conjectures as to
the cause of this durability; one of these was very
pungent, viz., &#8220;the invention was not by one of the
cloth.&#8221; An examination of the <a href="#Fig9">drawing</a> of the 68-pounder
carronade will enable the reader to perceive
the great similarity between this and the <a href="#Fig7">Russian gun</a>
before spoken of (see page 114).</p>

<img src="images/illo133.png" alt="" width="450" height="157" />
<p class="caption">68-pound carronade.</p>
</div>

<p>The manufacture of these guns was originally in
the hands of the inventors, and it is quite evident
that they must have taken great pains with the form
of the gun, and also have taken special care that the
material of which it was constructed was of the very
best quality.</p>

<p>There is too much reason to doubt the proficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a><br /><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of military men in the science of metallurgy; and the
British system of depending solely on their knowledge
for the last half century, has no doubt proved an
obstacle to advancement in the science of gunnery.</p>

<p>The gun which ranks next is Monck&#8217;s 56-pounder.
Although not a chambered gun, it will be seen, from
the <a href="#Fig10">diagram</a> (see p. 117), to be an attempt (if not a
perfectly successful one) to obtain uniformity of
thickness in every part of the arc. The durability of
these guns ranks as we have placed them.</p>

<p>The next in rotation is the <a href="#Fig8">8-inch or 68-pounder</a>
(see p. 114); which, although not the original sized

end of its very brief career.</p>

<p>The 10-inch gun of 95 cwt., <a href="#Fig11">delineated</a> at page 117,
will be seen to be defective in its outlines when tested
by the principles before laid down, and the fact of more
10-inch guns bursting at Sebastopol than any others
(mortars only excepted), may be taken as exclusive
evidence of its imperfection.</p>

<p>The bursting of mortars is quite notorious, especially
the 13-inch mortars used for sea-service in the
attack on Sweaborg. A slight examination of the <a href="#Fig12">engraving</a>
of one will be sufficient to convince any person
that, if what has already been advanced on the form of
guns can lay claim to being scientific, then this is
of all guns the most unscientific that was ever manufactured.
Its durability, too, like its shape, is of a
very low order.</p>

<p>Mortars will retain their place in spite of all
improvements. Rifling is inapplicable to them.
Their principal utility consists in obtaining a vertical
fire; the shell being pitched to a great height, so as
to fall into places that cannot be assailed by a horizontal
fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The late Joseph Manton has the merit of being
the first modern inventor of rifled cannon. His idea
was, that if a motion on an axis parallel to the
horizon could be given to cannon balls, they would
range farther and with greater accuracy. As there
exists great difficulty in causing the rifling in a gun
to act upon an iron ball, he constructed a cup of
wood, into which the ball was fitted, projections being
made upon the wood to fit into the groves of the
rifle; the spinning motion thus being communicated
to the ball by its wooden adjunct. The result was
twofold; for the expansions of the wood during the
explosion, filled the tube of the gun tight, and
effectually destroyed the windage. The government
of the day did offer him a premium of one farthing
each; but &#8220;Joe&#8221; over-reached himself, asking the
sum of &pound;30,000 down; this was refused, and the
patent was allowed to expire without the Government
taking any advantage of it, and experiments ceased
to be made in this direction.</p>

<p>Rifled cannon have now, however, become a
certainty. Mechanically speaking, they are as easily
to be produced as hand rifles. The general application
has, however, vast difficulties, which must be
overcome before their use can become general.
Small arm projectiles suitable for rifles must of
necessity be made of ductile metal, and all the
attempts previously made, whether with brass or
iron guns, are alike useless. The mass in motion,
even when of equal hardness with the gun (as in the
case of cast iron guns and cast iron shot), invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
destroys that in a comparative state of rest; and the
rifling is obliterated after a very few discharges. In
a brass gun the destruction is certainly not so rapid,
on account of the different nature of the metal; yet
the destruction of the gun for all useful purposes is
equally effectual. It is evident, then, that success
cannot be obtained by using the present materials in
rifled cannon; and the question inevitably arises,
what better material can we use? Wrought iron
shells have already been thoroughly tried in the Lancaster
oval gun, with a well-known result.</p>

<p>Great hopes were at one time entertained, that
something suitable would result from Mr. Bessemer&#8217;s
discovery of the combustion of carbon, and that an
iron of sufficient ductility, yet without the usual
hardness, would be produced; but this, it appears, is
still a myth.</p>

<p>Extent of range and accuracy of fire in gunnery
will in future be of so much importance in war, that
it is not extravagant to assert, that in contests
between well-matched belligerents, the precious metals
(if they gave any advantage to the user) would be
unhesitatingly used in projectiles. But on the score
of economy, science need not be impeded. Gun-metal
projectiles and cast steel cannon would work
as effectually together as lead and iron in small arms.</p>

<p>Some other mixtures less expensive might be produced
(lead and copper in certain proportions are very
ductile), and at the same time sufficiently strong to
resist all tendency to squash; as the softer metals
would inevitably do. The more ductile metals are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
limited in their utility, by the same law which limits
the use of pure lead: that is, to given weight, height
of column, or velocity. Great doubt exists whether a
bullet made of gun metal, and of the same proportionate
dimensions and form as an Enfield bullet,
but fitted for a ten-inch gun, would not, if fired with
the proportionate charge of powder (namely, seventeen
pounds), be as completely squashed, or driven in
upon itself, as the Enfield bullet if fired with the old
Brown Bess charge of four drachms and a half.</p>

<p>Considerable time and experience will be required
to ascertain the proportions of metallic mixture
necessary to meet all contingencies; this, however,
is a matter of detail, and must extend over so large
an area, that it can be handled only by the government
officials, with the necessary &#8220;sinews&#8221; of experiment.
Nevertheless it must be undertaken; and
the sooner it is done the better, for the prestige of
that nation which would lead the van of improvement
in gunnery, and increase its power of attack and
defence beyond those of its rivals.</p>

<p>Rifled cannon is a generic term of endless
application, presenting to the mind modifications
of projectiles in endless variety, ranging from the
&#8220;<em class="ital">light firebrand</em>&#8221; to the twice deadly rocket: not
rockets of that eccentric and erratic character by
which Congreve made an undying name; but real
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bon&acirc; fide</i> rifle rockets, which shall hit the dead-lights
in the quarter-gallery of a frigate, carry away
the halyards of your enemies&#8217; ensign (making him
drop his colours at the first shot) or dash the glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from the hand of the pilot. All such imaginary
feats will yet be accomplished; though the reader
may smile at the idea. My experience with rockets
goes to justify me in asserting that rockets discharged
from a gun, under certain circumstances, can be as
effectually controlled, and kept to a direct course, as
a bullet fired from a rifle. The rocket, however,
may be fired a much greater distance than we have
ever been able to project a bullet; because, in
addition to the force which projects it from the gun,
its flight is maintained by the self sustaining agency
in the body of the rocket. Rockets require a much
smaller charge of powder to project them than that
which is used for a bullet; a rocket started by its
own force, expends, in acquiring even an approximation
to its highest velocity, at least one-third of
the force with which it is charged; but when
projected by a small charge of gunpowder this force
is saved, and the flight of the rocket is afterwards
sustained by the force with which it is charged.</p>

<p>Firing rockets from cannon can only be practised
under certain circumstances. The observations
already made on the granulation of gunpowder will
have prepared the reader for this announcement.
When fired from a cannon under the old r&eacute;gime, the
rocket was projected at high velocity, and the case
of the rocket was destroyed by the very force which
set it in motion. A rocket suitable for artillery
should be cast of gun metal, with a frame of considerable
strength. In form it should nearly
approximate to an expansive bullet; but, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the limited length of one and three quarters
diameter; it should approach to four diameters;
two of which, at least, should be appropriated to
the cylinder behind the head.</p>

<p>The head is charged with composition more densely
driven than is customary in the ordinary rocket;
the tubes in the cylinder are also charged with a
composition equally dense. The outer frame of the
rocket is cast with suitable projections to fit the
grooves of the gun: the spiral of these grooves is
considerable, being one turn in every three feet, in
order to impart to the rocket an effectual spinning
motion when in a low state of velocity. The rocket
properly constructed is then placed in the rocket-gun,
and fired in the usual way; but it is essential
that the gunpowder used should be of a suitable
quality: its combustion must be as slow as possible,
a starting velocity of from 500 to 800 feet per second
being sufficient to ensure the flight of the self-sustaining
projectile to the end of its range. This principle
may be extended from a light firebrand, as already
stated, to that of a rocket charged in the head
with the most deadly and destructive fulminate.</p>

<p>It may appear absurd to speak of fulminates being
projected; since all experiments show that fulminates,
even when adulterated, will not stand the concussion
of a discharge, but invariably ignite in the gun,
however carefully placed or packed in the shell which
contains them: for this reason fulminates have
never been successfully used. But if the fulminate
is placed in the head of a rocket, this objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
may be obviated. The gradual manner in which
velocity is given to a rocket does not subject it
to violent displacement during its flight; neither
need the concussion in the gun be severe, owing
to the nature of the gunpowder used, which in its
gradual expansion is analogous to steam: thus the
field for the application of fulminates is opened to
an unlimited extent.</p>

<p>My own experience on this subject has been limited
to its application for the saving of life from shipwreck,
where the application of a line to the rocket
limits its range and velocity; but sufficient is left
in a rocket of an inch and a half diameter effectually
to carry out a line of a quarter of an inch diameter
to a distance of 600 or 800 yards: that is, more
than double the distance obtained by either Manby&#8217;s
apparatus or the rockets now in use; which, lamentable
to state, are quite inadequate to the purposes
for which they are intended.</p>

<p>Though the improvements in rifled cannon are at
present only in their infancy, they have nevertheless
attained to an extraordinary degree of perfection,
verifying all our predictions to the letter.</p>

<p>A writer in the <cite>Times</cite> makes the following
statements in favour of Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s improvements:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;While some men of really inventive talent, and
a great many charlatans, have been permitted to
waste the public money in trying vainly to improve
our artillery, it seems passing strange that it should
not long ago have been discovered how impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
it was to hope for successful results in the direction
in which they were working. It was clear that
while increased range and precision of firing were
wanted, it was nearly as important to bring the
charges of ammunition and the weight of metal
in guns into more manageable proportions to each
other, and to the facilities for transit on active
service. No sensible man can have witnessed the
frightful damage done to the efficiency of our army
in the Crimea by the exigencies of the siege-train
during the winter of 1854-5 without being impressed
with this conviction. The principle of the rifle
offered an obvious suggestion for the proper means
of working out the foregoing problem; but then for
artillery, rifling by grooves would not do without
the use of a pliant metal in the projectile, and
the cost of lead rendered its application to that
purpose impracticable. It was necessary, therefore,
to alter the existing mode of rifling, and to modify
the bore of the cannon, so that an iron projectile
could be discharged from it, rotating on its own
axis in the line of flight. This result once secured,
it is obvious that a field-piece or gun of position
would become a rifle on a large scale, and that the
same immense increase of range and of penetration
which had been realised by the smaller weapon as
compared with Brown Bess, would be placed at the
command of the artillery service. It is consolatory,
after a series of failures worthy even of Brunel in
launching the <i>Leviathan</i>, that the country has at
last the well-grounded hope of an improvement by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
which our ordnance may be placed on a proper
footing. In pursuing those careful experiments
which he undertook for the Government, principally
to improve the rifle, Mr. Whitworth, the eminent
machinist, adopted a polygonal spiral bore of a
uniform pitch, but more rapid than could be attained
by grooves. This bore has enabled him to surpass
immensely the range and penetration of the Enfield
rifle; but even these advantages, important as they
are, scarcely surpass those which it places within
the reach of our artillery service. The strain of
the projectile being distributed evenly over every
side of the polygon, iron can be substituted for lead in
the projectile, and this simple but beautiful mechanical
appliance at once becomes available for cannon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The powerful aid of the <cite>Times</cite> is &#8220;almost
success;&#8221; though in this instance it has signally
failed, the boasted accuracy there spoken of not
having been yet obtained. This has no doubt arisen
in part from the fact that Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s great
mechanical knowledge would not suffice to make him
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</i> at the compound science of gunnery. His
&#8220;polygonal spiral bore of uniform pitch, more rapid
than could be obtained by grooves,&#8221; is after all
only an experimental gun, not sufficiently developed
as yet for practical utility. Still, the writer already
alluded to has favoured us with the following remarks
in the <cite>Times</cite>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreover, Mr. Whitworth has discovered in the
course of his experiments, that according to the
quickness of the turn in the polygon is the length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of the projectile that may be fired; so that 24 lb.
and 48 lb. shot have been sent to extraordinary
ranges with half the usual charge of powder, from
an ordinary 12-pounder howitzer. Here, then, is
at once the solution of the whole question which
has troubled the brains of so many inventors, real
or pretended, for years. The artilleryman at one
stride resumes the relative position to the soldier of
the line which the Enfield rifle had so perilously
deprived him of, and this mechanical country, after
finding herself on the level of France, Russia, and
other European States, is once more, as during the
Peninsular campaigns, enabled to assert her natural
superiority in the manufacture of cannon. We trust
that no petty jealousies on the part of narrow-minded
officials will be allowed to interfere with the course
of Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s experiments, and that the encouragement
which he is now receiving from the
Minister at War and the Commander-in-Chief will
enable him, at no remote date, to realise for the
benefit of the army and the nation that revolution
in gunnery which the results already obtained by
him promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Report says that 25,000<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr> is the amount of encouragement
Mr. Whitworth has received from the
Minister of War and the Commander-in-Chief; an
adequate sum with which to conduct such an experiment,
but not sufficient to insure success.</p>

<p>Of the success of Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s polygonal
projectile, on a large scale, none need speculate, for
the principle is self-destructive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Lancaster&#8217;s oval shell, oscillated in its flight, took
a flight so extraordinary, on account of the resistance
of the atmosphere on the protuberances of the oval,
that the principle may be regarded as fully established
that enlarged projectiles must be smooth and free
from projections that &#8220;saw the air,&#8221; otherwise range
and accuracy of fire will be sacrificed. The principle
of Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s polygonal bore is fully discussed
in its proper place, and will here receive only a
passing notice.</p>

<p>To Mr. W. G. Armstrong, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
much more credit is due than can be claimed for
Mr. Whitworth. Long before the paid efforts of
Mr. Whitworth, Mr. Armstrong had made the
subject of rifled cannon a special study, and the
success of his investigations has been such as to
couple his name with those of the earliest inventors
of effectual rifled cannon. Mr. Armstrong may also
lay claim to being an originator of wrought steel
cannon; though here his name stands second as an
inventor, for to Mr. Krupp is due the honour of first
introducing cast steel cannon to the notice of our
Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong tells his own tale so well in the
columns of the <cite>Times</cite> that we cannot do better than
quote it:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;In the latter part of 1854, I submitted to the
Duke of Newcastle, then Minister at War, a proposal
for a gun which I anticipated would possess great
superiority over the common forms of light artillery,
and I undertook, with his Grace&#8217;s authority, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
construct a field-piece in conformity with the plan I
had suggested. The gun was accordingly soon afterwards
made, and has since, during a period of nearly
two years, been the subject of numerous experiments,
partly upon the ordnance firing-ground at Shoeburyness;
but principally under my own direction in this
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have hitherto avoided publicity in reference to
these experiments, but, as matured results of much
interest and importance have now been arrived at, and
as other names are already before the public in connection
with gun experiments made during the same
period, I feel that I may now, without impropriety,
give some information on the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a view to strength and durability, the gun
is composed internally of steel and externally of
wrought iron, applied in a twisted or spiral form, as in
a musket or fowling-piece. The bore is nearly two
inches in diameter, and is rifled. The projectile is a
pointed cylinder 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches long, and its weight is 5 lb.
It is made of cast iron, coated with lead, and is fired
from the gun with a charge of 10 ounces of powder;
it contains a small cavity in the centre, and may be
used either as a shot or a shell. When applied as a
shell, the cavity is filled with powder, and a detonating
fuse is inserted in front, so as to fire the powder in
the centre on striking an object. When used as a
shot, the powder is omitted, and an iron point, which
favours penetration, is substituted for the fuse. The
gun is constructed to load at the breech, the object
being not only to obviate the disadvantages of sponging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and loading from the front, but also to allow the projectile
to be larger in diameter than would enter at
the muzzle, and thus to insure its taking the impress
of the grooves and completely filling the bore. The
piece weighs 5 cwt., and is mounted upon a carriage
which bears a general resemblance to that of an
ordinary 6-pounder field gun, but which embraces a
pivot frame and recoil slide. A screw is also applied,
not only for elevating and depressing the gun, but
also for moving it horizontally, by which means great
delicacy of aim is effected. The recoil slide has an
upward inclination, which enables the gun, after
running back, to recover its position by gravity; and
its use is to relieve the pivot-frame and adjusting
screws from injurious concussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall now give some particulars of the experiments
recently made with this gun on the coast of
Northumberland, near the village of Whitley, under
the official inspection of Colonel Wilmot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen shots were in the first instance fired from
a distance of 1,500 yards at a timber butt, 5 ft. wide
7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> ft. high. Six of these were expended in finding
the elevation proper for the distance, but after that
was determined every succeeding shot hit the object
without previous graze. The final elevation of the
gun was 4 deg. 26 min., and the mean lateral distance
of the shot-marks from a vertical line through the
centre of the butt was only 11<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Persons who are conversant with artillery practice
will be able to appreciate the accuracy of this firing;
but, for the information of those who are unacquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
with the subject, I may state that the ordinary
6-pounder field-piece, which in point of weight forms
the nearest approach to the present gun, is perfectly
useless at a distance of 1,500 yards, and is very
uncertain even at 1,000 yards. It is only, therefore,
with heavy artillery that a comparison can be drawn;
and it will be sufficient to state that in tabulating
the practice made with such ordnance the deflections
are invariably recorded in yards, whereas with this
rifled gun they can only be properly given in inches.</p>

<p>&#8220;With respect to penetration, the following particulars
will be regarded as equally remarkable, considering
the small weight of the shot and the length
of the range. The butt was 3 ft. thick, and was
composed of six layers of rock elm bolted together, so
as to form a solid block. One shot passed entirely
through; another struck near the edge and glanced;
and the remaining six penetrated within a few inches
of the opposite side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shell firing was next tried at a distance of 1,500
yards; the gun being fired at the same elevation and with
the same charge as in the previous practice at the butt.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this case two targets were erected, one behind
the other, so as to appear as one object when viewed
from the gun, and a space of 30 feet was left between
them. The front target was intended to exhibit the
perforations of the shell before bursting, and the back
one to show the effect of the fragments resulting from
explosion.</p>

<p>&#8220;After some preliminary experiments twenty-two
shells were fired at the front target, and of these only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
one missed the object of aim. The following are the
particulars:&mdash;Seventeen hit the first target direct,
and burst behind it, the fragments penetrating the
second one; three grazed and burst immediately in
front of the first target, and perforated both with the
pieces; one hit the bottom of the first target and
exploded in the ground, and the remaining one missed
entirely and burst on some rocks nearly on line
beyond. A strong side wind was blowing at the time,
and accounted for the deviation of this single shell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four shells and three shots were then fired at an
elevation of 6 degrees, from a distance of 2,000, or,
more accurately, 1,964 yards. All these struck
within the breadth of the target; but the elevation
being scarcely sufficient, they all fell a little short,
except one shell, which, ranging somewhat further
than the others, hit the target and burst as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;The results of this shell-firing were as follows:&mdash;The
front target contained 51 holes, and the back one
164, while the ground between and adjacent to the
targets exhibited about 70 perforations by fragments
of shells, the greater portion of which were afterwards
recovered by digging.</p>

<p>&#8220;With respect to ranges exceeding 2,000 yards,
I may state that on previous occasions the gun
had been tried up to 3,000 yards&mdash;a distance which
was reached with an elevation of 11 deg., and the
usual charge of 10 ounces of powder, or 1-8th the
weight of the projectile. By augmenting the charge
the range is increased, but the accuracy is impaired;
and I therefore adhere to the 10-ounce charge, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
gives ample penetration, as the experiments at the
butt will testify. I may also observe that the ranges
obtained with this charge bear a favourable comparison
with those of the heaviest round-shot guns fired with
a much larger proportion of powder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a curious fact, and one which greatly increases
the efficiency of the shells, that owing to the bursting
charge requiring a minute space of time to mature its
ignition after the firing of the fuse by impact, the shell
is enabled to travel four or five feet after striking an
object before disruption takes place. Hence, therefore,
it acts as a shot before it bursts as a shell.
When it perforates a target the explosion may be seen
to take place at a few feet beyond, and when it grazes
it has time to rise, and may be observed to burst after
clearing the ground. If, therefore, it were fired
against a ship, it would first penetrate the side in its
entirety, and then, bursting, traverse the deck in
fragments; or if directed against troops, it would
pierce the front line as a bullet, and operate like
grape-shot beyond. The shells explode with equal
certainty whether the first substance struck be hard
or soft; and, in fact, they even burst on the surface of
water, provided the elevation of the gun be not too
great. The bursting charge is very small, but it suffices
to break the shell into about 30 pieces, which pursue
their forward course without too much dispersion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible to contemplate the results obtained
with this gun without being impressed with the important
part it is calculated to perform in warfare.
Opposed to any ordinary field-piece, it would be like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Greener rifle against the old musket; and no gun could
be worked at an embrasure if a fire of shells were
directed against it by one of these rifled pieces placed
within the distance of a mile. In naval operations,
also, guns of this description, but of larger size,
might apparently be applied with great effect&mdash;more
especially as a system of breech loading, combined
with a self-recovering recoil action, would be peculiarly
advantageous in firing from portholes. Even
light 5-pounders, sending their shells from great distances
through the sides of a ship and sweeping the
decks with fragments of lead and iron, would produce
very destructive effects; and a small swift steamer
carrying a few such guns might prove a very troublesome
opponent to a large ship of war. But if the
dimensions of the gun were increased so as to adapt it
for shells of 20 lb. or 30 lb., still more terrible injury
could be inflicted at greater distances; and the ponderous
artillery now used at sea would be of little
service when opposed to the accurate and long-range
firing of such rifled shell-guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since the publication of these remarks, rifled artillery
of Mr. Armstrong&#8217;s production has, we believe,
been extensively tried. The results of these trials have
been most extraordinary; and the principle is, we
believe, identical with the expansive principle bearing
my cognomen: an extension of the principle of the
Greener and Enfield rifle, hereafter to be described.
I have had the honour of being consulted both by
English and foreign authorities, and I have assisted in
constructing rifled artillery for several years; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
experience thus obtained justifies me in making known
to the world some of my observations on this subject.</p>

<p>Rifled cannon with elongated projectiles, similar in
shape and principle to the Greenerian bullet, give,
with charges inferior to those of the old r&eacute;gime and
calibre, more than double the range, with ten times
greater accuracy.</p>

<p>Now, either of these points, if gained, would be
most important improvements, and when combined
would produce the most extraordinary results. But
this is not all: a great diminution in the weight of
the gun might also be effected; and these advantages
may be still further extended when we have had time
to increase our knowledge of the valuable materials
with which we are only just now becoming acquainted.</p>

<p>The following table will show the advantages to be
gained both in length and accuracy of range.</p>

<p>Before reverting to the table, it may be necessary to
remind the reader that the great reduction in the
weight of guns arises from the adoption of the elongated
projectile. For example: the diameter of the
<em class="ital">elongated</em> projectile for an &#8220;18-pounder&#8221; is much less
than the diameter of the gun for the <em class="ital">spherical</em>
18-pounder; thus allowing the thickness of metal to
be equal in both guns. The gun for the elongated
projectile may be greatly reduced in weight without
at all diminishing its strength, simply on account of
the great diminution in the diameter of the arc.</p>

<p>There is another important fact, which Mr. Whitworth,
with all his boasting, has carefully concealed:
viz., that a much greater pressure is exerted upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
square inch in the lesser than in the larger diameter
of bore; and to conceal this fact, whilst claiming
merit for a bullet of 50-gauge exceeding in range one
of 25-gauge, the charge of gunpowder being alike in
both cases, appears very like deception. Any engineer
will tell us that the pressure in the lesser is twice
as great as in the larger bore; and this explains why
greater velocity is given to the projectile.</p>

<p>With these explanations the reader will be better
prepared to weigh carefully my observations. My
task would, doubtless, have been rendered more easy,
if a clear elucidation of the principles of the expansive
bullet could have been given thus early in the work;
but it is thought better to do this in its proper place.
I will only add here, that although two bullets, one
elongated, the other spherical, and of equal diameter,
meet with the same amount of atmospheric resistance,
yet the one containing twice as much matter as the
other retains its medium velocity nearly double the
distance. With these explanatory remarks I give the
following table:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The reader must understand that all the guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
given in this table were not rifled, and that they have
not all been subjected to trial. The 6, 12, 18, 24,
and 48-pounders have been tried, with the results
given above; but the heavier guns have not as yet
been tested: the ranges and weights given in the
table have, however, been derived from the results
yielded in the trial of the lesser guns, and may be
safely relied on as scientific data; being, in truth,
rather under than over the mark.</p>

<p>All experiments clearly establish one very important
principle, long known to those acquainted with the
science of projectiles, viz., &#8220;That the heavier the
projectile, the less the deflection.&#8221; Thus it is quite
possible that the longest ranges may ultimately be
obtained without any perceptible deflection. And when
we observe that the deflection of an ordinary 32-shot in
a range of 2,000 yards, is 50 feet, and in 2,500 yards,
80 feet, whilst the elongated shot, at a much greater
distance, is not deflected half as many inches, I think
we may fairly say that our knowledge of gunnery is yet
in its infancy. Fulminating powder may be used as
an auxiliary in shells for various important purposes;
such, for instance, as destroying an entire fleet; and
it is clearly within the range of possibility that by its
agency the largest ship may be destroyed by a single
shot. The accuracy of rifled cannon renders it an
easy task to strike a plank only one inch above the
water line, and the penetration of an elongated gun-metal
or lead-alloyed shell would enable us to reach
the innermost parts of the magazine: for it is scarcely
possible to produce even an iron casing which shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
resist the power of such projectiles. It is possible,
therefore, that we may see the noblest fleet destroyed
in a few minutes by the agency of such projectiles.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to give an outline of the method
by which this may be effected. A long rifled cannon,
constructed for an elongated gun-metal shell;
of from fifty-six to eighty-six pounds, and with an
extreme range of from 6,000 to 7,000 yards, may be
considered to be a suitable instrument. This shell
should be charged in the head with a given quantity
of the fulminate, such as would be most calculated to
prevent the tendency to explode from the concussion
produced by the discharge of the gun. It will be
necessary to place the fulminate in thin layers
between sheets of prepared caoutchouc, or some other
preparation of India-rubber; having thus arranged
the fulminate in the head of the shell and secured it
there, the usual method of filling the remainder is
resorted to, and the aperture is securely screwed up:
fuses not being necessary in this arrangement.</p>

<p>The difficulty in using this shell is to prevent its
explosion when the gun is discharged; and to obviate
this all our engineering skill is required. Time and
experience will show that, by a modification of the
propelling agent, the shell may be started from a
rifled cannon at a very low velocity; the velocity being
increased like that of the rocket. This is to be done
by modifying the arrangement of the gunpowder so
as to ensure the shell acquiring its greatest velocity
as it leaves the muzzle of the cannon. The result of
this has been already shown. On the shell striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
any object, such as the ship&#8217;s side, the metal of the
shell is driven in upon itself, and an explosion of
the fulminate follows as a natural consequence.
Experiment has proved that shells exploding as they
strike the ship&#8217;s sides, produce very little damage
beyond making a hole in the ship the size of the shell.
This, no doubt, arises from the short space of time
occupied by the shell in passing through the side of
the ship; all its force being exerted in the interior
instead of on the sides of the vessel. All shells of
the nature alluded to would, at certain distances, take
such a line of flight as to ensure them dipping
towards the centre of gravity, and thus exploding the
magazines, however deep below the water-line; and
when we consider the destructive effects of fulminates,
we think it quite within the range of probability
that they might produce all the effects we have
spoken of.</p>

<p>There are many agents equally powerful to be
introduced into destructive warfare; and with
the advantages to be derived from improvements
in rifled shells, which the ingenuity of the present
race will certainly effect, he would be a rash man
who would set any limits to the advancement of projectile
science. The great difficulty in the use of
fulminates will be surmounted if these suggestions
can be carried out; and experiment is all that will
then be necessary to establish the line of proceeding.
To effect this is the province of the Government of
the country; to wait for it to be perfected by individual
skill and enterprise would be unjust to science,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and injurious to the best interests of the nation. The
needful expenditure can only be borne by the nation,
and should be entered upon, in order to effect improvement
in projectiles, with the view of maintaining
our land and marine artillery at the highest point
of efficiency.</p>

<p>There is one question of great importance to
inventors, and to which I have paid much attention,
namely, the obtaining a spiral motion in a projectile
which has been fired from a smooth bored gun. All
we have witnessed goes far to prove that the attainment
of this is impossible, in consequence of a
principle not hitherto investigated by inventors. If
the course of a projectile is changed from the straight
to the spiral, it can only be done at the expense of
range; and that for the following reasons: first,
the force which is necessary to induce this spiral
movement must be exerted at the expense of the
force which propels it forward; secondly, when this
spiral movement is acquired, it is so much in excess
of the direct movement, that after advancing a
certain distance it falls to the ground. A very
simple experiment will prove this. Take an ordinary
tin tube, cut a bullet of an elongated form&mdash;cylindro-conical
if wished&mdash;having grooves from the point
backwards, with the degree of spiral necessary to
effect the object in view. Let the bullet be made of
cork or light wood, such as can be projected by a
blast from the mouth, and the result will be that the
projectile will go one-half the distance before the
friction of the atmosphere produces a motion on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
axis parallel to its line of flight; from this point it
gradually loses its velocity in a forward direction, it
spins until its force is expended, and then falls
vertically to the ground. To find the sequel, try
the same experiment without grooving, and the
range, with the same force, will be found to be
double. Some years ago I witnessed such a trial
with a 32-pounder; and, to the astonishment of all
present, the bullet rose above the horizontal line, and
then fell to the ground, like the cork bullet of which
we have already spoken.</p>

<p>The endeavour to produce breech-loading cannon
is an effort to obtain uncalled-for and superfluous
facility in gunnery; and if a perfect breech-loading
cannon could possibly be produced, what would it
avail? What superior property could it possess over
the solid gun? It could not be safety; for when we
consider the very limited number of explosions by
which the very best guns are destroyed, it can scarcely
be possible for a gun composed of many parts to
endure the intense vibrations to which large cannon
are subjected. The regular distribution of vibrations
in the metal of the gun is the great point to be
attended to in the construction of artillery; so that
vibrations may not be incorrectly induced by malformation,
or by an excess or deficiency of metal at any
particular point; for where the waves of vibration
are checked by an unequal distribution of metal, or
other causes, there the weak point in a gun is always
found, as all fractured guns clearly demonstrate. An
intimate acquaintance with the metallurgy of cannon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
enables me to give an almost unerring opinion
as to the causes leading to the fracture. Most
undoubtedly, vibration, if judiciously distributed, is
the soul of endurance; but if injudiciously distributed
is certain to result in the destruction of the cannon.
In structures composed necessarily of many joints,
obstruction to the waves of vibration must occur; the
different parts do not expand and vibrate equally; a
kind of revulsion is induced; part repels part, and
destruction ensues as a natural consequence. Under
no circumstances, therefore, can a breech-loader be as
safe as a solid gun.</p>

<p>The facility with which breech-loaders can be
charged is generally trumpeted forth to the world
as an advantage of vital importance; but let us carefully
examine this point and see if it has not been
exaggerated&mdash;whether, in fact, a solid gun cannot
be charged and discharged as rapidly as a breech-loader.</p>

<p>In the first place, all guns recoil; this necessitates
the relaying of the gun after every discharge,
in order to obtain accuracy of aim; and if facility of
loading is to be obtained at the expense of aim, it
can scarcely be called an advantage. Aim consumes
more time than loading. A six-pounder may be
loaded and fired six times in the first minute; but
it would be impossible to do this and re-lay the gun
after each shot. Where then is the advantage of firing
six shots per minute if you cannot hit six objects?
And if breech-loaders could be fired <em class="ital">sixty</em> times per
minute, what would they avail if aim was wanting?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
The raising or depressing of the breech of a gun by
means of the elevating screw; slewing to the right
or left, spunging the gun, and ramming home the
powder and shot, all consume time; hence we think
that quickness of loading is worthless.</p>

<p>Breech-loading cannon cannot be constructed for
bullets of larger diameter than that of the rifle bore,
without a ductile bullet be used; for, as is usual in
breech-loading small-arms, the bullet rifles itself as it
is forced up the grooves. The projectiles for rifled
cannon have hitherto been cast with corresponding
grooves and lands to fit the internal form of the cannon.
A compound shot, composed of iron, and covered
externally with ductile metal, has been tried in a few
instances; but, unfortunately, the difficulty of combining
two metals so dissimilar as iron and lead has
been found so great as invariably to end in a failure;
therefore no prospect exists of bringing into play
this, the best point existing in breech-loading arms.</p>

<p>Lastly, the tendency of all guns to absorb the heat,
developed during explosion, puts a limit to all extreme
rapidity of fire; even if this was not already limited
by the more essential point of taking aim. At
Sweaborg it was found necessary to allow an interval
of five minutes between each discharge of a mortar,
and yet the whole of them burst after an average of
120 shots. Time and ingenuity spent in planning
and constructing breech-loading cannon will always
end in disappointment and failure. Many are the
plans extant, evincing great skill, perseverance, and
everything needful in point of mechanical experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
but betraying a total ignorance of the metallurgic
science and of practical results from the use of the
engine. The study of these points will save money,
time, and what is of more value, brain-work, which
might be better employed. Striving to produce perfect
breech-loading cannon is like striving to square
the circle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="chapname">ON THE MANUFACTURE OF IRON FOR GUN BARRELS.</span></h2>

<p>A considerable progress in improvement has taken
place in manufacturing the higher quality of iron
since my last publication. Not that I arrogate to
myself any credit on that score, but it is evident that
good frequently comes of flagellations, whether on
the body or the mind. One part of human nature
will ever fear the exposure of bad qualities, while
another is emboldened to advance in improvement if
the slightest chance exist of success or encouragement.
Thus we often see men striving to produce
one invention on the back of another, with wonderful
perseverance, finding many blanks and rarely a prize;
for truly in this competing age, the mind must be
strong that can fight long. Bitter is the disappointment
of the truly ingenious mind, to see the produce
of his brains thrown as lumber into the <em class="ital">herring
barrel</em>,&mdash;as the printer terms the receptacle for what
he sets no value upon; while the valueless contrivances
of the mean and sordid are preferred and
rewarded, because they enable the manufacturer to
produce cheaper, by foisting on the public a deceptive
or a spurious article. All inventions for purposes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
deception, are readily, aye, eagerly, patronised; for
they return gold to the coffers sooner.</p>

<p>The improvement in the manufacture of gun-barrels
depends on the quality of the iron entirely;
for it would be a useless waste of time to endeavour
to make a good barrel of inferior metal. Science
and experience have worked a wonderful change in
the mixture of the superior qualities of iron: we
have had announcements of silver-steel barrels at
<em class="ital">ten guineas a pair</em> in the rough, of Brescian steel
barrels, carbonised iron, and I know not how many
more descriptions or compounds of metals, to form
the best material for high-priced barrels. We have
now metal which, in the rod, cannot be sold for less
than one shilling and twopence per pound: the iron
for a pair of barrels thus costing sixteen shillings
and fourpence. This is good; nay, more than good&mdash;&#8217;tis
excellent. But there is a dark side of the
picture, over which I would fain draw a veil: but I
must not. Belgium, France, Holland, and Germany,
are improving, are marching onward, and we, alas!
are standing still. Competition and cheapness combined,
are driving our gun trade into a labyrinth, out
of which it will be long ere it finds the clue of exit.
Our manufacture of inferior gunnery has certainly
reached a depth of inferiority which never any other
manufacture in the world reached, and I hope never
will.</p>

<p>During the existence of the slave-trade, many
thousand guns per year were made of what is, by the
trade, technically termed &#8220;<dfn>park paling</dfn>,&#8221; a material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
only fit for such purposes; and the cost of it was
only <em class="ital">seven shillings and sixpence</em> each <em class="ital">spike</em>; but
now we can furnish slave traders with ship-loads, if
they choose, at only <em class="ital">six shillings and sixpence</em> each,
and it is still supposed that one of these <em class="ital">imitation</em>
guns is the blood-money for a fellow-creature. It
would be a just and equitable law, if our legislature
would pass it, &#8220;That every man should fire the guns
he manufactures:&#8221; nothing would more surely tend
to improve the quality of guns of a low grade.</p>

<p>A considerable increasing difficulty attends the
obtaining of horse-nail stubs from the continent. In
various continental markets from whence we draw
our supply, the skill and ability of the gun-barrel
makers have increased; and the preference for
superior fire-arms which is gaining ground with
many continental sportsmen, has taught foreigners
the value of their old horse-nails; and hence their
increased scarcity. The inferior iron of which we
make horse-nails prevents entirely the use of our own;
consequently it requires no foresight to predict that
our manufacturers will soon resolve themselves into
two descriptions&mdash;the very best and the very worst.
The latter are already actively employed, and the
others are advancing; as no doubt an increasing
desire to obtain the most perfect gun pervades the
thinking and affluent portion of the sporting world.</p>

<p>The manufacture of iron is a science truly worth
the consideration of the philosopher, for it is fraught
with the most important consequences, considered
either as a material of commerce, or the means to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
end. In advancing manufactures and the progress of
improvement, it has had an effect on civilization
unequalled by any known product, gold not excepted;
for no substitute exists for iron, or ever did. No
doubt the ancients had their bronze, of which they
could form edge tools, even razors; but that was a
very limited use of cutting tools: enough, perhaps,
for war or subsistence, but not for the progress of the
arts.</p>

<p>Of the first discovery and use of iron we have no
record; though its value may be presumed from the
fact, that Quintus Curtius mentions that &#8220;Alexander
of Macedon, received a present from Porus, an Indian
chief, of about 30 lbs. weight of steel.&#8221; If this were
a present fit for the conqueror of the world, its value,
even at that early date, must have been great
indeed.</p>

<p>For many centuries, up to the sixteenth, all iron
was produced by the aid of wood charcoal; and with
such contracted and limited means, it was found that
not more than 50 per cent, of the metal contained
in the ore was extracted; consequently at this day all
the ancient deposits of <em class="ital">slag</em> are sought for and
re-smelted, yielding a handsome return to the manufacturer.
The adoption of coal coke was a matter of
necessity, but it has been productive of extensive
benefit in all manufactures of iron of medium quality.
The opinions of many men of science lead to the
belief that it has benefited the higher quality also;
but I am quite satisfied of the reverse. The quantity
formerly obtained in the yield was, as shown, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
50 per cent. of the quantity existing in the ore; but
yet it was the purest metal: for it is unquestionable
that the best is soonest fused.</p>

<p>The iron ore of Great Britain is, beyond a doubt,
inferior to that of many parts of the world; as all
attempts to produce good steel from it have been
attended ultimately with disappointment. Mr. Mushet,
in his excellent work on iron, says, &#8220;The successful
exertions of individuals have increased the manufacture
of cast and malleable iron beyond all precedent
in this country; nor have we been without
some enlightened individuals, who have laudably
endeavoured to form a superior quality along with
the extension of their manufactures. Success has so
far crowned their praiseworthy exertions, aided by
the operation of knowledge, in removing the prejudices
of the artisan, that bar iron of our own manufacturing
has been substituted, to a great extent, in place
of that formerly used of the Swedish and Russian
marks; but hitherto all attempts have failed to make
bars of proper quality to form steel, in any degree
comparable to that we daily manufacture in great
quantities from foreign iron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we remain at an immense distance behind;
and while our manufacture of iron goods exceeds the
collective exertions of all Europe, we humbly feel
our dependence upon two foreign markets for the
supply of that steel-iron, without which the beauty,
the utility, and extent of our hardware manufactures
would be essentially injured and abridged.</p>

<p>&#8220;The policy of the foreign holders of this article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
communicates many undue advantages to the favoured
few to whom the steel-iron is consigned in this
country. The rapid progressive rise in value of
this iron, for many years past, has already nearly
doubled the price of steel to the workman, and given
the trade in general a melancholy foretaste of the
evils of dependence and <em class="ital">monopoly</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it is with the scrap, requisite to form good
iron for gun-barrels. I have had several pairs of
barrels sent from Berlin and Vienna, to be fitted
up in the English style, with a certain knowledge
that they were wanted for patterns; and in justice
let it be said, the material and figure in the barrel
were most beautiful: being a variety of Damascus,
or fancy pattern in the metal, <em class="ital">superior</em> to anything
seen of this country&#8217;s manufacture. True, this is not
an essential requisite, being more for appearance than
utility; but the fact clearly shows the industry and
will of the artisan. The iron, too, in clearness and
density, we can scarcely surpass; therefore, if I regret
that we are not advancing with our competitors, it
proceeds from a clear conviction of the truth that
we are slumbering upon our fancied superiority. A
friend who had lately visited Liege, informed me that
in one gun-maker&#8217;s shop alone, were employed fourteen
of our best workmen; in fact, he brought with
him a gun which attests the great improvement the
Belgians have made of late years. I have had
possession of three guns, bearing on the lock and
barrels, &#8220;Joseph Manton, London;&#8221; &#8220;Joseph Egg,
London;&#8221; and &#8220;John Manton and Son, London;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>&#8221;
all of which were manufactured in Belgium; and
so well is the imitation executed, that it would
puzzle most amateurs to discover the fraud.</p>

<p>Recently a company, entitled &#8220;The Indian Iron
and Steel Company,&#8221; has commenced importing and
and manufacturing iron and steel from Hindostan ore,
and native-made bar iron.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> If they succeed in competing
with Sweden and Russia, this iron will be a
valuable acquisition to the British empire. They
have already issued a quantity 35 per cent. cheaper
then the latter, but quality is the end they should
strive for. However, the business is in able hands,
and I have no doubt but that this object will be kept
prominently in view.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The fine quality of the Indian steel is generally acknowledged.
The iron is first obtained by smelting, in small quantities, the
wootz-ore, or the magnetic oxide of iron, which it found combined
with about 42 per cent. of quartz; the yield being, out of 100 parts
of ore, only 15 parts of metal: but this is of the finest character.</p>

<p>The process by which the iron is converted into steel is as
follows, and fully accounts for that peculiar quality for which the
Indian steel is valued.</p>

<p>The iron is cut into pieces and packed closely in a crucible of
clay, containing about 1 lb. only of the iron, mixed with a tenth
part of dried wood cut small, the whole covered over with green
leaves. The crucible is then stopped, by covering the mouth with
tempered clay, so as to effectually exclude the air. After a time
that is, as soon as the clay-plugs are sufficiently hard, from twenty
to thirty of the crucibles are built up in an arched form placed in a
small blast furnace, and kept covered with charcoal; thus being
subjected to the heat of the furnace for two or three hours. The
process is then complete.</p>

<p>As soon as the crucibles are cool, they are broken open and the
cakes of steel are found rounded at the bottom.</p>

<p>The top of the cakes should be found covered with stri&aelig;, radiating
from a centre, and be free from holes or rough projections. If
the cakes are honeycombed, the process has been imperfect and
incomplete. When re-melted and tilted into rods, a very superior
article has been the result.</p>

<p>The natives prepare the cakes for being drawn into bars, by annealing
them for several hours in a small charcoal furnace, excited
by bellows; the current of air being made to play upon the cakes
while turned over before it, whereby a portion of the combined
carbon is dissipated and the steel probably softened: without which
operation the cakes would break in drawing them. They are drawn
by a hammer of only a very few pounds weight, but the repeated
hammering greatly tends to the production of a highly condensed
and perfect article.</p></div>

<p>Foreseeing the difficulty that would eventually
beset us in obtaining a sufficient supply of old horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
nails from Germany and elsewhere, I directed my
experiments to steel entirely, having formerly perceived
that where the greatest quantity of steel
existed in the mixture necessary to form material for
their best gun barrels, there also existed the greatest
tenuous strength. I had at that time a decided
objection to all steel, as the following quotation from
&#8220;The Gun&#8221; will show:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;We recommend hammer-hardening in all mixtures
containing iron. If you throw the iron aside,
and confine your manufacture wholly to steel, it would
be an evil, from this simple cause:&mdash;steel is of itself
close enough in the grain; hammering it, therefore,
in a cold state, only tends to make it more brittle.
But the reverse is the case with iron: the more it is
beaten the greater becomes its tenacity; and when
mixed with steel in the way the stubs-composition is, it
prevents the particles of steel from becoming too hard.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Adams, of Wednesbury, and the successors of
Mr. Clive, of Birmingham, manufacture a considerable
quantity both of silver steel and common twist steel
for the trade; I make my own laminated steel: the
difference in silver steel and common twist steel
merely consists in the variety of tortuous twisting
the former undergoes, while the latter is rolled out
into rods of 6-16ths broad, with the fibres running
perfectly longitudinal. The method of making or
welding the pieces into a bloom, is in the following
way. Having collected a sufficiency of mild steel
scraps, such as cuttings of saws, waste from steel
pen making, old coach springs, and the immense
variety of pieces arising from the various manufactures
of tools, they are cut into pieces of equal
dimensions, polished in a revolving drum by their
friction on each other, until quite bright, and then
placed for fusion on the bed of an air furnace.
The parts first fused are gathered on the end of a
similarly fabricated rod, in a welding state, and these
gather together by their adhesion, the remainder as
they become sufficiently heated, until the bloom is
complete. The steel is then removed from the furnace,
and undergoes the effect of a three-ton forge
hammer and the tilt, until it forms a large square bar;
it is then re-heated, and thence conveyed to the rolling
mill, where eventually it is reduced to the size of rod
required. I generally have the metal required cut
into short pieces of six inches long. A certain
number are bundled together and welded, and then
drawn down again in the rolling mill. This can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
repeated any number of times&mdash;elongating the fibres
and multiplying their number to an indefinite extent
as may be required.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig14" id="Fig14"></a>
<img src="images/illo172.jpg" alt="Welding steel" width="550" height="390" />
</div>

<p>The great advantage derived in this instance from
air-furnace welding is a chemical one; for while the
small pieces of steel are fusing on the bed of the air
furnace, the oxygen is extracting the carbon, and
leaves the resulting metal mild steel, or iron of the
densest description; while the succeeding hammering
and rolling and re-welding, produce the mechanical
arrangement of making the whole of an extremely
fibrous description. The polishing secures a clean
metal; indeed, so free from specks are the generality
of barrels thus made, that it is scarcely possible to
imagine clearer metal. When contrasted with the
best of ordinary iron, by a powerful microscope, the
closeness and density of grain are strongly apparent.</p>

<p>To such an extent has this been carried, that I
can produce specimens of a considerably increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
specific gravity. The barrels made of this metal, in
general, beat all tried against them; with this great
advantage, that the finer the polish in the interior
the better they shoot, and continue longer free from
lead. The only difficulty is in the working; as the
boring, filing, &amp;c., are more difficult. Moreover,
greater care is required to see that they are not
annealed,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> when in the hands of the borer or filer;
for in such case they would be considerably injured,
though not to the same extent as barrels of a softer
nature. I tested a great variety of bars by drawing
them asunder longitudinally by the testing machine,
and the average strength of a rod of 6-16ths broad
by 5-16ths thick and 12 inches long, containing
1&middot;40625 solid inches of iron, was equal to a tension
of 11,200 lbs. This furnished a barrel having a
thickness of metal in all parts of the arch equal, or
3-16ths of an inch thick, capable of bearing an
internal pressure of 6,022 lbs. to the inch of the tube.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Dr. Ure falls into an error in describing the process of barrel
boring: he says &#8220;the barrel is first properly annealed, and allowed
to cool gradually,&#8221; &amp;c. The barrel-maker that would take such a
proceeding with a barrel of ours should never do so to another.
The Doctor ought to have pointed out the evil tendency of this.
We never saw it done, and we doubt much whether he did, though
we have heard of the practice, which induces us to notice it, but
the Doctor describes it as a <em class="ital">necessary</em> proceeding.</p></div>

<p>The generality of barrel makers spoil this metal
by an attempt to obtain figure; for all extreme
twistings in the rod depreciate the metal, by separating
the fibres: to borrow a simile, they obtain
only an over-twisted rope. This is not only disadvantageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
but useless; for the extreme density
of the metal renders the figure difficult to be shown
distinctly, as acid acts upon it but slightly, and never
so well as on metal fabricated from two differently
constructed carbonised materials.</p>

<p>Many conjectures have been advanced, and an
endless discussion created, to account for the watering
or &#8220;<dfn>jowher</dfn>&#8221; in oriental sword-blades, and genuine
Damascus gun-barrels. Anything approaching the
truth is seldom met with; though I think the explanation
is very simple. It must be well known that
there is an immense variety of different qualities in
both iron and steel: no uniformity of quality is found
in two productions out of a hundred. The very ore,
the coal, the presence of oxygen, the excess of it, all
vary the quality of the material. An excess of carbon
is more detrimental than a scarcity; for where carbon
has once been, it leaves an indelible mark, and though
extracted to as great an extent as practicable, it
leaves a residue that possesses an affinity to absorb
carbon again equal to the original quantity: thus,
steel once made will never, by any process yet known,
be reconverted back to iron of the same nature it was
originally.</p>

<p>Mr. Mushet has given us the proportions of carbon
<em class="ital">held in solution</em> by the various qualities of steel and
iron, and the reader will find them in the note
below.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It inevitably follows, as a principle, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the quantity of carbon contained in the metal&mdash;avoiding
cast iron&mdash;will increase or decrease, and
thus regulate the degree of hardness of the metals in
question. A quantity of metals dissimilar in this
particular, mixed together, and run into a vessel in
a state of fusion, then, when cold, filed and polished,
will show a variety according to the place they hold
in the crystallised mass. Work and twist this material
in all the tortuous ways and shapes it is capable
of, and you only twist the fibres of the different
bodies in the same way; and when they come to be
acted upon by acid or oxidisation, they still retain
their relative positions, forming the watering or
figure, as was the intention of the tortuous twisting.
All the beautiful arrangements in Damascus figures
are obtained in this way. Metals containing more or
less carbon will always produce this watering. To
obtain a satisfactory proof, any person may case-harden
a few pounds weight of stubs, and afterwards
melt them in a crucible, and run them into a receiver;
when these are worked down into the bar (or not,
as he pleases), dress and apply a little sulphuric acid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and the peculiar situation the various stubs had taken
in the fluid state, will be clearly discernible.</p>

<p>The original barrel-welders, the real Damascus
iron-workers, were, like some of ours of the present
day, not the most <em class="ital">conscientious</em> individuals, nor the
most honourable. For, strange to say&mdash;but it is not
more strange than true&mdash;on examination of most real
Damascus barrels to be met with, we find the iron
must have been so valuable as to induce the workmen
<em class="ital">to plate</em> or <em class="ital">veneer</em> the superior mixture over a body
of the commonest iron: all large barrels are thus
made, rifles especially. I presume the moderns <em class="ital">borrowed</em>
the invention; and it would be well if they
made no more extensive use of it than on rifle barrels.</p>

<p>The modern method of making wire-twist and
Damascus iron, being gradations from the same
material, are here described under one head:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Alternate bars of iron and steel are placed on each
other, in numbers of six each; they are then forged
into one body or bar; after which, if for the making
of wire-twist barrels, they are rolled down into rods
of 3-8ths of an inch in breadth, varying in thickness
according to the size of the barrel for which they are
wanted: if for Damascus, invariably 3-8ths of an
inch square. When about to be twisted into spirals
for barrels, care must be taken that the edges of the
steel and iron shall be outermost; so that when the
barrel is finished and browned it shall have the
appearance of being welded of pieces the size of wires,
the whole length of the barrel. A portion of the
rod, pickled in sulphuric acid, exhibits the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig15">appearance</a>, the bright parts being the steel, the other
the iron.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig15" id="Fig15"></a>
<img src="images/illo177a.jpg" alt="Damascus rod" width="500" height="88" />
</div>

<p>When about to be converted into Damascus, the
rod is heated the whole length, and the two square
ends put into the heads (one of which is a fixture)
of a kind of lathe, which is worked by a handle
similar to a winch. It is then twisted like a rope
(or, as Colonel Hawker says, wrung as wet clothes
are) until it has from twelve to fourteen complete
turns in the inch, when it presents this <a href="#Fig15a">appearance</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig15a" id="Fig15a"></a>
<img src="images/illo177b.jpg" alt="Wrung Damascus" width="500" height="96" />
</div>

<p>By this severe twisting, the rod of six feet is shortened
to three, doubled in thickness, and made perfectly
round. Three of these rods are then placed together,
with the inclinations of the twists running in opposite
directions; they are then welded into one, and
rolled down into a rod 11-16ths of an inch in
breadth. Being pickled in acid, to eat away the
iron, it exhibits the following <a href="#Fig15b">appearance</a>:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig15b" id="Fig15b"></a>
<img src="images/illo177c.jpg" alt="Pickled Damascus" width="500" height="106" />
</div>

<p>This iron has long been held in great esteem. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
looks pretty; but certainly does not possess either the
strength or tenacity of wire-twist iron. It is well
known that the strength of a rope may be destroyed
by twisting it too much: so is it with this sort of
iron. Iron is best when not twisted at all: I speak
of the bar. It resembles wood, inasmuch as the
strands or fibres run parallel, firmly adhere, and add
strength to each other; if you twist those fibres you
tear them asunder, and they no longer support each
other. So it is with iron.</p>

<p>The objection made to the wire-twist is, that owing
to the iron and steel being perfectly separate bodies
running through the whole thickness of the barrel,
there is a difficulty in welding them perfectly; and,
of course there is danger of their breaking across, at
any trifling imperfection or mis-weld. This objection
is certainly well grounded, as many barrels break in
the proving. I have seen a very strong barrel indeed
broken across the knee without the slightest difficulty,
while, to all appearance, it was perfectly sound. This
is the reason why the manufacturers have ceased to
make them, except for the American trade.</p>

<p>It may be said that the fibres in the Damascus,
after being torn asunder, are welded anew. True;
but could you ever glue the fibres of a piece of wood
(twisted in the same way) together again, to make
them as strong as before? No: cut several pieces of
wood across the grain and glue them together, you
would not expect them, though equal in substance
with a piece in which the grains run lengthwise, to
be of equal strength. In short, I hold a Damascus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
barrel to be little superior to a common barrel, in
which the fibres run parallel to the bore.</p>

<p>All the varieties of figured barrels are but modifications
of Damascus. The most endless variety possible
may be attained; a figure with the carbonised material,
showing only the ends or edges of the various
lamin&aelig;, or portions of the face of that lamin&aelig;, may
with equal facility be obtained, if the patience of the
artist be in proportion. It would be a never-ending
task, a subject for many volumes, to endeavour to
describe a tithe of the varieties that might be, and
have been made.</p>

<p>The Belgians are very expert at this sort of ornamental
work. The very minute Damascus figure
they frequently produce, is admirable, if beauty alone
were the advantage sought in a gun barrel. They
use thirty-two alternate bars of steel and iron, and
roll them into a sheet of 3-16ths thick, and then slit
them by a machine into square rods; these are twisted
in the way just described, but to such an extreme as
to resemble the threads of a very fine screw: six of
them are welded into one, instead of three as with us.
The figure is so extremely fine as to appear not to be
larger than the finest needle. I have seen barrels
made in Liege, superior in minute figure to any real
Damascus barrel, or sword either. Our workmen
here say the steel is better; which I am inclined to
think is true: it is a branch of the gun manufacture
they have long excelled in. The very best &#8220;Damascene&#8221;
workers are to be found at La Chafontaine, a
few miles from Liege, where they dwell in as beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a dell as fancy could wish, with a powerful hill-stream
working their boring and grinding-mills, thus enabling
them to send their barrels into Liege, ready for the
filer. I have spent considerable time, and taken
great trouble, to produce in Birmingham iron equally
good; and I have succeeded: but, unfortunately,
Englishmen are so extravagant in their ideas of
value, as to render the constant manufacture of this
iron here, a losing speculation. It can, however, be
obtained from Belgium now, under the amended
tariff, at ten per cent. on the value. It can be
purchased there, ready for barrel making, at a franc
per pound; and cheap it is at that price: two and a
half francs would not purchase it here.</p>

<p>That Damascus iron is incompatible with goodness,
I can and shall clearly prove. Experiment with the
testing machine shows a rod of wire-twist 3-8ths
square, containing 1&middot;6875 solid inches, as equal to a
tension of 11,200 lbs.; whereas a rod, when converted
into Damascus of 11-16ths of an inch in
breadth, by 4-16ths in thickness, containing 2&middot;625
solid inches, was only equal to 8,960 lbs.; thus showing
a clear loss of full thirty-five per cent. And when
welded into barrels of the dimensions described, the
relative internal strength of each is 5,019<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lbs., and
3,292 lbs. <em class="ital">to the inch of tube</em>. This constitutes a
great difference. But unfortunately that is not all.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter I noted the fact, that all
sorts of iron lose a portion of their strength by being
heated or softened; but I found that Damascus suffered
more than any other sort of iron, excepting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
common kinds. For instance, the bar of wire-twist
would, in the state it came from the rolling mill, bear
11,200 lbs., but, after softening, it would only bear
10,180 lbs., being a diminution of 10 per cent. A
bar of Damascus suspending a weight of 8,940 lbs.,
the measure of its strength, when annealed, was
7,840 lbs., being a falling off of 12<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent. Thus, I
trust I have clearly shown, that whatever other quality
Damascus possesses, strength is not one of its properties.
It must not, however, be supposed that the
above weight indicates its greatest strength; on the
contrary, its strength can be increased full 22<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per
cent. by cold hammering. Still, however, it will only
hold its relative position to other kinds of iron with
respect to strength, since they are all capable of having
their strength increased by the same process.</p>

<p>Damascus barrels have fallen much into disuse,
being rarely seen except as pistol barrels,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which,
together with a great quantity of <em class="ital">counterfeits</em>, are
made for the South and North American trades, in
the shape of double and single guns of a flashy
appearance&mdash;all invariably <em class="ital">veneered</em> or <em class="ital">plated</em> with
ribbons of this ornamental iron. I shall now dismiss
this subject; after remarking, that certainly a very
handsome barrel may be made after this principle, if
too much twisting be avoided. It has been seen that
the rods are twisted until there is fourteen turns in
the inch of length: an excess productive of the detrimental
effect mentioned; while, had there been but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
two turns, a large proportion of strength, if not all,
would have been retained. One turn only, under the
same circumstances, would very likely be highly beneficial;
indeed I have found it to be so: one twist
binds the interior strands, as the outer does the
interior in a rope, and thus adds strength. This
shows that there is a medium in all things.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The London makers are again using them extensively; which
is certainly no proof of their judgment.</p></div>

<p>The use of old horse-shoe nails is of a date nearly
coeval with the use of small fire-arms. These nails
are made from rod iron of the best description; and
the hammering cold, or tempering the nail, so benefits
and condenses the iron as to improve it greatly. The
method in use until a late period, was to fill and force
into an iron hoop, of six or seven inches diameter, as
many stubs as it would contain, to weld the whole,
and draw them down to a bar of such dimensions as
might be required. Modern improvement, however,
has shown the advantage of cleansing the stubs perfectly
by a revolving drum, and then fusing and
gathering them into a <em class="ital">bloom</em> on the bed of an air-furnace.
Thus a body of from 40 to 50 lbs. of
melting iron can be obtained at one heat; a matter
of economy and necessity, where large quantities are
required, besides possessing the superior advantage of
having the whole mass equally heated: this cannot be
done by the old hoop method, as the surface must be
frequently burnt before the interior is at all in a
welding state.</p>

<p>Experience taught the late Mr. Adams and his
brother George&mdash;who still manufacture some of the
best gun iron in the world&mdash;that the stub iron alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
was insufficient; for even then (forty years ago) the
absurdity of imagining that no barrels were or could
be good without being soft, was understood and acted
upon by them. They introduced at first one-fourth
of steel to three of stubs; this having been found
highly advantageous, the prejudices of the gun-makers
were gradually overcome, or left in abeyance
from ignorance of the introduction. It is a fact, that as
late as 1842, when I issued my former work, men who
had been all their lives <em class="ital">gun-makers</em> (by courtesy)
actually refused to believe that any steel at all entered
into the composition of the best barrels; and several
whom I know perfectly well, ordered the factors with
whom they dealt &#8220;to be sure to send them no
barrels with steel in, as they did not wish their
customers&#8217; hands to be blown off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charcoal iron has, up to this day, been the only
stub twist barrels they (and we believe two-thirds of
the provincial makers also) have ever been served
with. Reason with these men, and they will snappishly
tell you, &#8220;We pay the best price, and we ought
to have the best: we don&#8217;t see that our neighbours
have any better.&#8221; On one occasion of my calling
upon one of the first provincial gun-makers in the
kingdom, the subject of barrels was adverted to&mdash;&#8220;An
excellent work that of yours, I dare say; but,
sir, you have done a deal of harm: it is wrong to let
gentlemen know too much; they give you far too
much trouble: they get too knowing.&#8221; These, and
such like observations, are the only thanks I ever
received from the generality of the gun trade. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
are, however, some enlightened men who, understanding
the subject, have appreciated my motives; but by
far the greater proportion have done the reverse,
asserting &#8220;that I had told them nothing but what
they knew before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mixture of a portion of steel with the stubs
having clearly shown an improvement, an increased
proportion has been adopted by various makers: we
have had as high as three-fourths of steel to one
of iron. Where proper attention is paid to the clipping
of the steel to pieces, corresponding with the
stubs, and properly mixing the whole, welding and
forging by the heavy hammer, reducing by a tilt and
rolling down to the smallest description of rod, a most
excellent, tenacious, and dense body of iron is thus
obtained; while, by cutting into lengths of six inches,
bundling a number together, and re-welding them into
a bar, an increased density and tenacity is gained, by
an increase in quantity, and an elongation of the
fibrous system. Any description of barrel, of this
iron, if made with a moderate degree of care and
attention, is considerably stronger than any explosive
fluid ever yet compounded could burst, under any
circumstances bordering on <em class="ital">fair experiment</em>.</p>

<p>The great advantage derived from welding on the
bed of an air-furnace, arises from an absence of the
minute portions of charcoal, of either wood or coal, as
the case may be. Millions of these very minute portions
are imbedded in the midst of the metal in every
part. They are enclosed in cells originally of their
own dimensions, but are drawn out with the fibres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to an indefinite extent, forming a system of tubes that
may be compared to the capillary system in trees, and
making the iron of a spungy, compressible nature.
It is the absence of these particles of charcoal that
gives part of the superiority to steel as now made for
gun-barrels; and the existence of a portion of them
causes the inferiority of all other kinds of iron. In a
chemical analysis of iron, a large portion of crude
coal-charcoal or wood-charcoal is found, according as
either has been used during the manufacture. This
is not of course given as so much carbon in the result,
though the injury is equally detrimental as an excess
of carbon is to the goodness of the metal; for it
renders the whole porous, and liable to attract moisture
and induce oxidation. It must be kept prominently
in view, and clearly comprehended, that the
denser the body of metal, the less the liability to
oxidise, or in other words <em class="ital">rust</em>; and here is the one
great preservative principle in good iron: &#8220;it is the
fibre of dense cocoa-wood, compared with that of
willow or saugh.&#8221; In all situations and for all purposes,
where iron is liable to sudden changes of either
heat or cold, wet or dry, the very best of iron should
be obtained; as it will be less affected by the changes
of temperature, and amply repay by its durability the
extra cost in the first instance.</p>

<p>The very extensive round of experiments to which
I have submitted mixtures of this nature, clearly
establishes all the conclusions I have formed on these
points. The strength of the mixture, three parts
steel to one of stubs, gives a resistance in the rod of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
6-16ths broad by 5-16ths thick, and 12 inches long,
containing 1&middot;40625 solid inches, equal to 10,295 lbs.
before separating; thus being equal, in a barrel of
the dimensions before mentioned, to an internal
pressure of 5,555 lbs. to the inch of tube. The
proportions mentioned in my previous work are
25 lbs. of stubs to 15 lbs. of steel; the strength of
this mixture in the rod is equal to a tension of
8,960 lbs., and the barrel is capable of restraining a
pressure internally of 4,818 lbs., making full 15 per
cent. dissimilarity in favour of the larger proportion
of steel: indeed, all experience points to the great
advantage, that steel, properly worked, possesses over
iron alone. Great good can be effected by condensing
iron by hammer-hardening; greater than I have
shown steel to be capable of receiving additionally:
as, already having it naturally, there is no necessity
for using artificial means to obtain it. Nor is steel so
liable to depreciation in the hands of an inexperienced
artisan; as the degree of expansion is not more, in
the large proportion of steel mixture, than a loss of
strength equal to 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent, by heating and
cooling gradually. The loss in the mixture containing
less steel is 7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent. The specific gravity
of the two is in proportion.</p>

<p>The frequent welding and re-rolling of iron is of
the most beneficial tendency, the elongation of the
fibres being highly advantageous; for, a fibrous piece
of iron may be compared to a wire rope, the more
strands the greater tenacity; and the smaller the
strands, even up to a proximity of fineness to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
human hair, the greater the weight they will bear in
tension. One large wire which, when single, will suspend
500 lbs., will, when drawn down to six small ones,
suspend 600 lbs.; and so on to the greatest extreme.
Another great advantage received by the repeated
reworking of iron, is obtaining an increased density;
for when this is secured to a certain extent, you have
closed in proportion the pores of the metal; and in
this state it is not liable to that degree of expansion
or contraction, or that fluctuation in strength, which
arises from softening the iron. Nor can you gain,
save to a limited extent, any improvement by hammering,&mdash;hammer-hardening,
for instance,&mdash;simply
because it is already improved to the utmost extent we
are at present acquainted with.</p>

<p>How wonderfully beneficial to mankind is this
beautiful arrangement of the metallic fibrous system!
Without it what could we do? our manufactures
would be confined to simple castings, or crystallizations,
possessed merely of strength in proportion to
the cohesive nature of the metal. Where would be
all the wonderful springs whose fineness vies with
the silken fibre? Of what could they be constructed?
All-powerful gold would not suffice, nor
silver; though each, in its place, possesses wonderful
properties. Gold and silver may both be spread in
the thinnest conceivable coat over space incredible;
on the gilded cup, or, still thinner by electric agency,
on the plated epergne. But iron alone is to the arts,
the &#8220;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i>&#8221; for which there is no substitute:
it is the &#8220;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qu&acirc; non</i>&#8221; of practical mechanics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Improvements in the manufacture of a very
superior iron may, we believe, be placed to the
credit of the gunmaking profession exclusively; no
other body or class of men having ever yet deemed
it worth their trouble to endeavour to obtain anything
of a better description <em class="ital">than bar iron, suitable to make
steel from</em>. Mr. Mushet, from whose work I have
already quoted, has evidently been more intimately
acquainted with the routine of iron manufacturing
than any other person I ever met with or read of:
he understands the question perfectly; yet he seems
to care for nothing further <em class="ital">than a suitable steel iron</em>.</p>

<p>How many and how fearful have been the explosions
by all-powerful steam since the period of its
introduction. How many weeping widows, and how
many fatherless children have had to mourn its
effects! Yet what has human ingenuity done, what
have the wonderful energies of the present race of
scientific men accomplished to stay this annual
slaughter? Comparatively little beyond discovery
of mysterious causes where none exist. It reminds
me of my first lesson in coursing&mdash;&#8220;If you want to
find a hare, young man,&#8221; said the keeper, &#8220;look at
your feet: you will not find her at a distance.&#8221; So
it is with the state of knowledge on steam boiler
explosions; if you want to find the cause, look &#8220;at
your feet:&#8221; do not endeavour to envelope in mystery,
what you may find in simple and natural causes.</p>

<p>I may here observe that I have been professionally
engaged to inspect the effects, with a hope of finding
the cause, of thirty-four cases of explosion, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
sacrifice of human life was above an average of two
each, or nearly one hundred, and I never yet have
found one single case which could not be clearly demonstrated
to have been caused either solely by neglect
of the superintendent, or from sheer ignorance on the
part of the engineer constructing the arrangement of
boilers. For every accident may <em class="ital">sweepingly be said</em>
to be occasioned by a want of space for the escape of
the steam: a too small valve, in the first instance,
and in the second, a villanous construction of what
is called iron boiler plate&mdash;a concentration of the
veriest rubbish, under the name of wrought iron, ever
gathered together. For this reason, I have drawn
the reader&#8217;s attention aside for a few moments.</p>

<p>The improvement of boiler-iron may detain us
slightly, if by the delay any good can be accomplished.
For an inconsiderable increase of outlay, a boiler
might be rendered doubly safe to what it is at
present, by simply using moderate caution in the
selection of scrap iron, a perfect cleansing of that
scrap, and by fusing the bloom on the bed of an air
furnace. The great advantage would be that you
would get a stronger, a much denser, and consequently
a much better, metal: nor is this all the
advantage; you might use a very much thinner plate,
which would yet be equally strong; and science will
tell you that steam would be more easily generated,
as heat is more rapidly conducted.</p>

<p>There is a very handsome description of barrel-iron
made, generally termed &#8220;Stub-Damascus.&#8221;
The method of preparing it, is of late considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
altered. A quantity of old files are hardened, by
being; heated red-hot and immersed in water, then
broken in pieces with a hammer, and afterwards
pounded in a mortar until the pieces do not exceed
in size a corn of number five shot. A proportion of
15 lbs. of these to 25 lbs. of stubs, is fused together on
the bed of an air-furnace, beaten down, and rolled
into rods. The rod of 3-8ths of an inch square, is
twisted like a rope, precisely in the same way as the
Damascus. The effect of this winding, is to give a
beautiful mottle to the barrel; which will be found
depicted in <a href="#Plate3">plate No. 3</a>.</p>

<p>Another mixture, represented in <a href="#Plate2">plate No. 2</a>, was
first made by Mr. Wiswould, of Birmingham. It is
a compound, so far as I have been able to ascertain,
of three parts of steel to two of iron, intimately
blended and intermixed, and twisted as just described.
It is a most beautifully clean and dense iron; but the
extreme twisting is to it, as to all, highly injurious
and prejudicial. The twisting is similar to the
Damascus; only that two twisted rods are welded
together instead of three, and with the twist of the
strands running in opposite angles, as depicted in the
<a href="#Fig16">wood-cut</a> below.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig16" id="Fig16"></a>
<img src="images/illo190.jpg" alt="Steel and iron twist" width="500" height="112" />
</div>

<p>The degree of strength is similar to that of the
stub, and other Damascus; it being quite certain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that, be the composition what it may, this rending of
the cohesive attachment by twisting, will eventually
equalise the strength of the whole.</p>

<p>The use and introduction of what is called
&#8220;charcoal-iron,&#8221; is one of the shams reared and
supported by the hotbed of competition and deception
combined: a wish to foist on the purchaser a
counterfeit for the real metal. I would not give
shop-room to the best barrels ever made from such
a compound. I hate a scoundrel and a hypocrite;
this iron exemplifies the qualities of both.</p>

<p>This worthless compound consists principally of
cuttings of sheet iron; of which there is an endless
supply in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, from
punchings and from one inferior metal and another.
After properly cleaning, a quantity is put into a
charcoal furnace and melted, cast into a pig, then
forged down to a bar, and rolled into rods corresponding
with the size of stub twist, which it is
intended to represent. The action of the charcoal
communicates to it a portion of carbon, which, when
stained in a certain way, gives an appearance much
resembling that beautiful metal just mentioned (stub-Damascus);
but if every means imagined by the
inventive faculty of man were employed upon it,
it could not be made into really good iron. An iron
which is technically termed &#8220;weak,&#8221; can never be
made a strong bodied iron, or an &#8220;iron suitable to
make steel,&#8221; to repeat a former quotation. The
original iron from which these scraps generally come,
is required to be &#8220;weak&#8221; iron, for the facility with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
which it can be rolled into plates; a strong fibrous
iron is not necessary.</p>

<p>Its greatest strength appears to be as follows:
7-16ths of an inch broad, and 5-16ths thick, solid
contents 1&middot;40635 inches, will bear a weight of 10,080
pounds; so that if my calculations are correct, it
will bear only a pressure of 4,526 pounds in the
tube. The loss of strength by heating or softening,
being full 10 per cent.</p>

<p>This converted iron, however, will not endure the
test of browning by smoke, or, more properly, flame;
as the oxygen invariably destroys the appearance of
steel in twelve hours after its application. By the
old method of staining, it would be as impossible
for any man, who was not a judge, to point out the
real from the counterfeit, as to discern a copy executed
by a clever artist from an original painting by one of
the old masters.</p>

<p>But deception is ever fertile in expedients, and an
ingenious invention was soon found out to imitate
the advantage possessed by the &#8220;<em class="ital">smoke brown</em>,&#8221;
which they obtain by first browning or staining the
barrels very dark. A weak solution of muriatic
acid, or spirits of salt, is applied very lightly with
a sponge, and the colour is extracted from those
portions of the iron left more prominent, by the
excessive <em class="ital">pickling</em> they are subjected to before
staining; they are then immediately dried, scalded
with hot water, and the stain is complete; it is a
most ingenious imitation.</p>

<p>I have already stated that this iron is very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
used in consequence of its cheapness; its cost being
only fourpence per pound, while stub twist costs
fivepence. It is also easily worked, being considerably
softer than any of the above-described kinds of
iron.</p>

<p>It may be asked, why so much inferior iron is
used, when the difference in the price between the
good and the bad is only a penny per pound? The
reason is this:&mdash;If a barrel filer receive an order
for a pair of barrels, he (having probably deceived
his customer before, or, at any rate, knowing that
he can deceive him without running any risk of
detection) sends to the welder sufficient charcoal-iron
to forge these barrels. Should the quantity amount
to ten pounds, he, of course, saves tenpence. The
welder receives two shillings less for welding this
description of iron, than for welding stub-twist; so
that here is already a saving of 2<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> At the
boring-mill, and the grinding-mill, the charge is also
proportionate: the wages of the journeymen are less;
so that by imposing on his customer one pair of
barrels manufactured of this sort of iron instead of
the real stub-twist, he pockets a clear gain of above
9<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr>; and should he manufacture one hundred pair
of such barrels in the year, it would make at
the end no small item in the year&#8217;s account of
profit.</p>

<p>Thus it is with all description of barrels. The
charge for making, by each workman, in the various
stages of the manufacture, is according to the quality
of each pair of barrels. The saving, then, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
man who makes one hundred pairs of barrels in the
year, though it be but a farthing in the pound of
iron, amounts to a considerable sum. This fraudulent
gain of more than 5<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr> on a pair of pretended stub
barrels, is what is called in Birmingham, &#8220;doing
the natives,&#8221; and is a reward for ingenious knavery.</p>

<p>When orders are given by what are called general
factors, who very kindly supply their country friends
at a moderate commission of 40 to 50 per cent.,
these gentry take care to lap up the cream; for
we know from facts that the barrel filer has sometimes
scarcely five per cent. for his trouble of overlooking.
One consequence naturally results from
this, that every species of deception will be resorted
to, in order to indemnify workpeople for their labour
and trouble. At the present time, I have no doubt
that there are hundreds of guns made in Birmingham,
the barrels of which, in some instances, never
enter the proof house: as eightpence per barrel, the
cost of proof, is a great temptation! Besides, a great
number of barrels declared &#8220;wasters&#8221;&mdash;such as
repeatedly bulged in the proof, are full of flaws,
have holes in the sides, or some other fault sufficient
to condemn them in the eyes of a moderately conscientious
barrel-maker&mdash;are bought by men who
live by this species of fraud; and are repaired with
great neatness, by putting in pieces artfully, beating
down swellings or bulges. Then the proof-mark &#8220;of
doubtful identity;&#8221; and, last of all,&mdash;mark!&mdash;they fit
them up, and send them to the engraver to have the
name of some living or defunct London gun-maker of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
respectability engraved upon them, and palm them off
upon some dealer as a good article.</p>

<p>I commend to the reader the advice of &#8220;Edward
Davies,&#8221; a gentleman who wrote in 1619; who says
&#8220;He that loves the safetie of his own person, and
delighteth in the goodness and beautie of a piece,
let him always make choice of one that is double
breeched; and if possible, a Mylan piece, for they
be of tough and perfect temper, light, square, and
bigge of breech, and very strong where the powder
doth lie, and where the violent force of the fire doth
consist, and notwithstanding thinne at the end. Our
English pieces approach very neare unto them in
beautie and goodness, (their heaviness only excepted)
so that they be made of purpose, and not one of
these common sale pieces, with round barrels, whereunto
a beaten souldier will have great respect, and
choose rather to pay double money for a good piece,
than to spare his purse and endanger himself.&#8221; Truly,
the fraternity have always, we find, been of doubtful
honesty: always making &#8220;sale pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Threepenny skelp iron&#8221; is made from an inferior
quality of scrap to that from which &#8220;charcoal iron&#8221;
is made; but unlike it, there is no pretension of
quality. Its inferiority is not denied; it is poor in
quality, and suits parties who cannot buy better.
The method of preparing is by an air-furnace, forge,
tilt and rolling mill, as before described. The greatest
strength of a bar 11-16ths broad by 3-16ths thick,
containing 1&middot;5468 solid inches, is 7,840 lbs.; or equal
to an internal pressure of 3,841 lbs. to the inch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
tube. One particular fact attaches to all kinds of
inferior iron&mdash;the greater the mass acted upon by
the rollers the greater the variation of strength.
This arises entirely from the increased sponginess of
the metal, and its greater expansibility. For instance,
a rod 1-16th thicker, is 15 per cent. weaker in proportion;
and so on to the greatest extent. But
on the other hand, it is capable of recovering a
great increase of strength by cold hammering;
greater than better iron. A considerable quantity
of this iron is sold to engineers, and used in the
construction of locomotive and other engines; the
price and uniformity of texture in grain fitting it
for that purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twopenny&#8221; or &#8220;Wednesbury skelp&#8221; is almost
too bad to be used in making an article which may
endanger the limbs of our fellow creatures, and is
now little used, fortunately. It is made of an inferior
scrap to the former, in precisely the same manner;
and in point of strength is still lower. The bar is
generally 1 and 1-16th inches in breadth, by 3-16ths
thick, the solid contents 2 inches and 25-64ths, and
will bear a weight of 7,840 pounds; consequently
the strength will be 2,840 pounds to the inch of
tube.</p>

<p>This is a great falling-off in strength; and I would
ask any one who values the safety of his hand, if he
would like to risk it, by using a gun made of iron
possessing so low a degree of strength, as compared to
the force of the charge it has to bear? Let him
recollect that the force of the charge may be increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
by a variety of circumstances. The pressure of a
certain quantity of powder, on which a certain weight
of shot is placed, is so many pounds to the inch; and
if you double that weight of shot, you nearly double
the pressure. In estimating the force of pressure, the
opposing friction is also to be taken into account. If
the gun be allowed to get very foul, then friction is
increased, and of course a still greater pressure is
thrown on the tube of the barrel. All these circumstances
being taken into consideration, I repeat, that
<em class="ital">no barrel is safe, whose power of resistance is not more
than double the strength of a charge of sufficient force
for general shooting</em>. Every bad gun should be
thrown aside as unsafe, or used with the greatest
caution. Bad and inferior guns are made from
the foregoing material; and not many years have
elapsed since it was thought good enough for military
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sham damn skelp&#8221; is made from the most inferior
scrap. I should not have mentioned this description
of iron had I not seen hundreds of barrels made of it,
all which are utterly unfitted for the use of any person
who cares at all for his safety. I have met with them
frequently under the dignified name of twisted barrels.
Guns that are fitted up at from ten to twelve shillings
each are not of course patent breeched, but are made
to appear so by staining them generally blue, and by
having a couple of bands to imitate platina, across the
squares. A projecting part is welded on to the side,
into which the nipple is inserted, and the lock joints
neatly under it. Many of them are good imitations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
but only take the barrel out of the stock and the
deception is instantly apparent, as it is rarely carried
further than the outside. The beautiful way in which
the barrels are painted to imitate fine twist, catches
the eye of the simple countryman, who is generally
the dupe of this artifice; and the persuasive eloquence
of the itinerant hardwareman, seldom fails to extract
from the pocket of his unsuspecting purchaser sometimes
thirty or forty shillings of his earnings for what
the <em class="ital">modest trader</em> rarely pays above fifteen shillings.
Many are the anathemas vented, when the deception
is found out by some one more knowing than the
dupe, who not unfrequently purchases his experience
at the expense of a finger or a hand. It is astonishing
what a quantity of this rubbish is disposed of by
hawkers who infest market towns and villages with
guns for sale.</p>

<p>But the English peasant is not the only dupe of
this species of knavery. Thousands of these guns
are sent monthly to the United States, to the Brazils,
and South America; where they are disposed of,
among the poor Indians, in exchange for skins and
furs.</p>

<p>They are all understood to be &#8220;proved.&#8221; How many
are so who can tell; but that some of them are not,
there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>It is said that the manufacture of these guns is a
great support to the gun trade of Birmingham. In
one respect it is, certainly; yet would not the interest
of the trade be advanced, if we were to manufacture
none of so inferior a quality? &#8220;But then,&#8221; it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
urged, &#8220;we could not compete with our rivals in
Germany and the Netherlands.&#8221; True, we should
not be their rivals in the production of rubbish; but
the superiority of our guns would then command a
better market. By sending to the market an article
no better than theirs, we have made foreigners indifferent
about the purchase of ours: they say &#8220;The
English guns are no better than the Belgian or German;
we may as well purchase one as the other.&#8221;
The force of this remark is illustrated by the state of
the African trade. The base kind of articles we
supplied them with some years ago, has produced a
distrust of our manufacture, which will not easily be
removed; and a similar distrust is engendered by the
same cause in the minds of our present customers. It
is much to be deplored that the eagerness for present
gain, should render men blind to the consequences of
their conduct, and lead them to prefer the immediate
gratification of their avarice even to their own future
prosperity; to say nothing of the welfare of the trade
of the country.</p>

<p>The method I suggested of testing all iron in the
bar would go far to destroy this trade. I have not
thought it worth while to test this iron. But
twist barrels are made of it. Should the reader
meet with a double gun so made, let him avoid it:
it is unsafe, unless it be so heavy as to be unmanageable.</p>

<p>A great many long rifle barrels are made of this
iron, principally for the American trade; but from
their immense weight, and the small charge of powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
required, there does not exist the same danger from
their use.</p>

<p>Fowling-piece barrels made of it may be generally
recognised by the smallness of the bore and the
thickness of metal. As the charge of powder used in
proving is very small when compared with the charges
for proving guns of a wider calibre, we need not be
surprised that many of those that are proved stand
proof.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swaff iron forging&#8221; is a profitable branch of
forging carried on in Birmingham under the above
title. It is a metal which is composed of iron and
steel filings, chippings of breeches, pieces and cuttings
of the ends of the screws, lock-plates, cocks, the
rough borings of barrels, and all other small scraps
found in gunmakers&#8217; and other workshops. These are
collected by the boys in each shop, and when they
have accumulated, are sold to the &#8220;swaff-forger,&#8221;
the proceeds being considered as drinking money.
They are forged into bars of iron by attaching them
together and immersing them in diluted sulphuric
acid; then, after draining it from them again, and
placing a large iron pan full in a hot situation, they
become cemented together by the action of the oxide.
The compound is then taken from the pan, by turning
it upside down, and is put into an air-furnace heated
to a welding heat, being thence removed and beaten
into a bar: three men with light hammers beating
it as quickly as they do in welding a gun-barrel.
This iron is sold to the gun-work forgers, for the
forging of the patent breeches, lock-plates, furniture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and other parts of the gun which they think worthy
of good iron; but since cheapness has become so
much the order of the day, the use of this iron is
confined to the forging of best gun-work, cast
iron being thought quite good enough for common
gun-work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="chapname">GUN-MAKING.</span></h2>

<p>In this chapter I shall briefly describe the process of
the manufacture of guns of all qualities, commencing
with barrel-welding; which, in importance, is inferior
only to the <em class="ital">quality of iron</em> in the routine of good
gun-making.</p>

<p>Birmingham, and the surrounding districts, are the
only places in England where barrel-welding is practised.
The superior advantage possessed in having
coal nearly (if not entirely) free from the presence of
the sulphuret of iron, which has always been found a
considerable hindrance to the obtainment of clear and
good barrels, is greatly in their favour. For a considerable
period individuals in London contended
with the Warwickshire welders; but being an
unequal contest, it ended in favour of the provincialists.
This is to be regretted, as there can be no
doubt but that greater reliance could be placed on
the material of the London manufacture. But a considerable
drawback existed with the latter: they
made only one sort of barrel, and that the best. Now
it is requisite to have a fire fitted for the purpose of
welding best barrels&mdash;tempered, as it were&mdash;and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
can only be effected by some hours&#8217; using, which is
generally employed in the production of a number of
very inferior barrels. As the London people made no
common guns, and needed no inferior barrels, they
welded their best barrels in a raw, untempered fire;
and hence arose the admitted inferiority of their
work. The late Mr. Fullard struggled long and
hard in the competition; but with his death, barrel-welding
ceased in the metropolis. Indeed it would
have been highly imprudent and unprofitable for any
one to have entered upon such a speculation; there
being no certainty of success, but rather of the contrary.
The Birmingham barrel-welders are wonderfully
clever smiths: they cannot be excelled. If
<em class="ital">ridden with a curb</em>, they do well; but no opportunity
must be given them, or to a certainty they will
&#8220;bolt&#8221; from the true path.</p>

<p>The metal rods are twisted by means of two iron
bars, the one fixed the other loose. In the latter
there is a prong or notch to receive one end; and
when inserted, the bar is turned by a handle. The
fixed bar preventing the rod from going round, it is
bent and twisted over the moveable rod like the
pieces of leather round the handle of a whip. The
loose bar is unshipped, the spiral knocked off, and
the same process recommenced with another rod.
The length of all the spirals depends on the breadth
of the rod: for instance, the stub-twist has sixteen
circles in six inches long; a rod of five feet will make
a spiral of only seven inches; while iron, of an inch
in breadth, will make a spiral of as many inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
long as there are twists: hence the reason why best
barrels have more joinings than common ones of
equal length.</p>

<p>The Damascus being rolled into rods of 11-16ths
broad forms a spiral with the appearance shown in
the accompanying <a href="#Fig17">woodcut</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig17" id="Fig17"></a>
<img src="images/illo204a.jpg" alt="Spirals of Damascus" width="500" height="158" />
</div>

<p>The fancy steel barrels and others, where the rod
is formed of more than one piece, such as the stub
Damascus, &amp;c., is of rather greater breadth, like the
<a href="#Fig17a">representation</a> below.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig17a" id="Fig17a"></a>
<img src="images/illo204b.jpg" alt="Spirals of Damascus" width="500" height="163" />
</div>

<p>The iron made from stubs and steel, and plain
fibrous steel, is invariably rolled down into rods of
6-16ths broad, forming a spiral, as <a href="#Fig17b">below</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig17b" id="Fig17b"></a>
<img src="images/illo204c.jpg" alt="Spirals of Damascus" width="500" height="161" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>A proper attention to the fineness of the spiral will
always enable an amateur to detect any attempt at
imposition.</p>

<p>The spiral formed from the rod of charcoal iron
has a somewhat different appearance; but in cases
where it is intended to supply the place of the real
stub iron it is of corresponding dimensions, and in
general very difficult to detect without a very intimate
knowledge indeed of the nature of iron. When
honestly intended, it forms a similar spiral to the
<a href="#Fig18">accompanying one</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig18" id="Fig18"></a>
<img src="images/illo205a.jpg" alt="Spiral of charcoal" width="500" height="163" />
</div>

<p>The wideness of the twist, or the angular direction
of the fibres, will enable the most uninitiated to
recognise a barrel made from threepenny skelp iron:
the very few welds required, is one cause of the
cheapness of barrels made from it. Judgment may
be formed of it from the following <a href="#Fig18a">representation</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig18a" id="Fig18a"></a>
<img src="images/illo205b.jpg" alt="Spiral of skelp" width="500" height="173" />
</div>

<p>Twopenny, or Wednesbury skelp is coarser in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
spiral still, and running so angular as not to be very
difficult to detect.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig19" id="Fig19"></a>
<img src="images/illo206a.jpg" alt="Spiral of Wednesbury iron" width="500" height="174" />
</div>

<p>All iron formed in spirals, as a matter of certainty,
forms <em class="ital">twist barrels</em>&mdash;the parties whose use they
are intended for, seldom know or care for anything
further than having &#8220;a twist barrelled gun.&#8221; The
advantage of <em class="ital">sham damn</em> iron being twisted is all
imaginary: if used at all, it may be twisted; but
those who value their safety would consult it best by
tying a large stone to such a gun and sinking it
fathoms deep. But to satisfy those who may fancy
such things, I give a <a href="#Fig19a">woodcut</a> of the spiral ready for
welding.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig19a" id="Fig19a"></a>
<img src="images/illo206b.jpg" alt="Spiral of 'sham damn' iron" width="500" height="166" />
</div>

<p>The spirals being thus formed, the welders commence
their day&#8217;s work. The batch consists of a foreman,
one on whose skill all depends, and two subordinates,
whose duty it is to blow the bellows, strike, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They proceed to weld probably a dozen long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
common barrels for the American trade; which are
generally composed of the inferior iron mentioned
before, rolled into two lengths of different thicknesses.
These skelps are heated, and beaten on a
groove until they form a tube half closed. They
are then heated again, and closed with one edge
over-lapping the other; as a brazier would over-lap
the edge of a tin pipe, for boys to blows peas with.</p>

<p>Having got the two lengths of the whole dozen
turned into tubes, they proceed to weld the longer
length or forepart, by heating it sufficiently for four
or five inches, introducing a mandril of the required
size to suit the bore wanted, and then beating it
into a perfect tube, in a groove on the anvil, of
corresponding diameter; heating it again and again,
until the joint is closed the whole length. They
then proceed with the other eleven foreparts, and
advance the whole to that stage before welding on
the breech lengths; which are now partially heated
by laying on the outskirts of the fire, to be in readiness:
they are then closed the same as the foreparts.
The end, when about to be jointed, is opened
a little on the peam of the anvil, to admit a portion
of the end of the forepart; which is introduced
as soon as both are in a welding state: the mandril
is then introduced, and the joint is perfected, in less
time than we have occupied in the description. The
other part of the tube is closed, and the barrel is
then complete. If, however, the breech part is to be
square or octagon shaped, it is not welded in a groove,
but on a plain surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Competition has reduced this department of the
trade to a low ebb; thousands of these sort of barrels
being now annually welded for about eightpence each:
if to this we add one penny farthing per pound for
six pounds of iron, we get a forged gun barrel for one
shilling and threepence halfpenny. This is certainly
a poor remuneration for sweating over a furnace
containing from two to three hundredweight of
intensely heated coal. The introduction of welding
by the rolling mill, will eventually supersede this
arrangement; a matter to be regretted only on the
score of its answering the purpose of preparing the
fire for best welding. Of late years rolling has nearly
superseded this description of welding.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig20" id="Fig20"></a>
<img src="images/illo208.jpg" alt="Barrel welding" width="550" height="358" />
</div>

<p>They now commence the welding of twist barrels.
Spirals that are intended for the breech end, are
heated to a welding heat for about three inches,
removed from the fire, and jumped close by striking
the end against the anvil. Again they are heated,
and again jumped, to ensure the perfect welding.
They are then beaten lightly in a groove, to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
them round. The neatest part of the process consists
in the joining of the points of the two rods, so
as to make the barrel appear as if it had been twisted
out of one rod. The ends of the two rods are a
little detached, brought from the fire, and applied
to each other; a gentle tap is then given, and the
union is perfect in an instant. The rapidity and
dexterity with which this is accomplished, ought to
be seen to be duly appreciated. This trouble is only
taken with the best barrels. In the manufacture of
barrels of an inferior description, the ends of the rods
are cut in a sloping direction, and when welded
together, become quite square at the part where the
pieces are joined. In a finished barrel the points of
junction are easily recognised. By tracing the twist,
a confusion will be found to exist for about an eighth
of an inch, every six or seven inches; and from
this appearance you may conclude that, for a barrel
so joined, the welder had not the best price. Having
joined the whole of the spirals, three inches are again
heated to a welding heat, the mandril is introduced,
and the tube hammered, in a groove, to the size
required. This operation is repeated until the whole
length is finished.</p>

<p>Then follows hammer-hardening: that is, beating the
barrel, in a comparatively cold state, in a groove, with
light hammers, for the space of half an hour. This
is a most important part of the process. It closes the
pores, condenses the texture of the metal, compresses
a greater substance into less bounds, increases greatly
the strength of the barrel, and renders it more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
elastic. Yet this is seldom done, unless specially
requested; and then a gratuity is, of course, expected
either in money or beer. A few pots of the juice of
Sir John Barleycorn will infuse more strength into
your barrels than you could purchase for ten times
the amount in money; as they have the effect of
making the hammers descend with increased velocity.</p>

<p>If all barrels were hardened in this manner, their
shooting powers would be increased, and they would
not be so liable to burst in the hands of the sportsman.
This, however, cannot be done, unless the
purchaser either sees it done himself, or has it done
under the superintendence of some person on whom
he can depend. The Birmingham workmen, if well
paid and well looked after (to counteract the bad
habits they have acquired from being employed in
the manufacture of so large a quantity of goods of an
inferior quality), would produce an article superior to
any that could be produced, at the same cost, in any
other part of the world.</p>

<p>The Belgian welders do their work at considerably
less cost in coal than our English workmen. Coal,
it is well known, is very dear in Liege, and necessity
may have taught them the extreme of economy both
in the size of their fire and the duration of it. They
effect this by adding to two-thirds of coal, beat into
dust, one-third of clay; the latter is mixed with the
coal by being put into a wooden barrel, the two well
stirred up together, and the water drained from it.
Even this mixture is used sparingly: the fire being
scarcely larger than might be held in the two hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
while with us little short of two hundredweight suffices:
which is unquestionably a great and unnecessary
waste. True the Belgian does not get through
the great quantity of work the Englishman does by
having &#8220;<em class="ital">a great many irons in the fire</em>&#8221; at once;
but he certainly does it well and clean: the quantity
of earthy matter in the Belgian&#8217;s fire gives a great
heat, which also is retained longer; and it is also free
from any excessive quantity of particles of charcoal.</p>

<p>All twist barrels undergo a similar round; the time
and care bestowed upon them depending entirely on
the price, which varies from one pound per pair down
to eighteenpence, and in some instances lower.</p>

<p>In a former work I noticed the introduction of a
villanous system of covering or plating barrels with
fine iron over a body of very inferior iron. I here
quote that description:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The deceptions practised in this branch of manufacture
are numerous, and injurious to the trade.
For instance, if you wish to have a heavy single
barrel made from Damascus, or any of the best irons,
and you send to the manufacturer the weight of iron
required, the probability is, that unless you superintend
the manufacture yourself, iron of an inferior
quality will be introduced into the inside of the
spirals. By this fraud they obtain iron worth threepence
a pound more than that which they knavishly
insert into the barrel. I had been repeatedly told of
this practice, but was incredulous. However, I gave
an order for four very heavy rifle barrels to be made
of Damascus iron. They were made; but on pickling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
these barrels for the purpose of showing the
figure of the Damascus, I discovered that the iron
seemed to be much more easily eaten away at the
muzzle than on the surface. This led me to examine
them, when I found that the inside was entirely composed
of iron, over which the covering of Damascus
had been twisted. But for the pickling, this fraud
never would have been detected; yet for these barrels
I was charged at the rate of two barrels for each.
Since this occurred, I have subjected many heavy
barrels to examination, and have found the fraud to
be very common. The practice is not only dishonest,
but spoils the gun, by destroying the shooting power,
in consequence of the metals, being of different temperatures,
not acting together at the moment of expansion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig21" id="Fig21"></a>
<img src="images/illo212.jpg" alt="Method of plating barrels" width="500" height="165" />
</div>

<p>Veneering or plating barrels is more extensively
practised in Belgium than in any other nation we are
acquainted with; they do not conceal it, but they
use equally good iron, though not ornamented iron:
of this there is much doubt. The method of accomplishing
this is by having the iron required rolled down
into ribbons of a thin description; these are twisted
spirally round a tube of common iron having the fibres
running length-ways, or parallel with the bore. The
accompanying <a href="#Fig21">cut</a> will convey an idea of this method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Many will ask what inducement have the welders to
take this extra trouble? Gain. The cost of Damascus
is 7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> per pound, and the iron they use for this
purpose is only 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> A pair of barrels take 14 lbs.
of iron; say 6 lbs. of this is Damascus plate, costing
3<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr> 9<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; 8 lbs. is common, amounting to 10<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> instead
of 5<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr>, or a saving of 4<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> a pair. A splendid
profit if you order one hundred. The borer charges
less, the iron is softer, the filer has less, and all
items clubbed amount to something. The facility
with which welders can do this is wonderful; it
clearly establishes their ability, and proves their
claim to be considered the cleverest <em class="ital">blacksmiths</em>
on the face of the earth. It is not only the best
descriptions of iron they plate with: twopenny skelp
is more in use than any. It is now rare to meet
with <em class="ital">painted</em> barrels: all are <em class="ital">genuine twist barrels</em>,
<em class="ital">warranted</em>; for they are mostly all plated, even
down to the gun costing but fourteen shillings,
wholesale price.</p>

<p>This is a subject of serious importance; one which
the gun-makers, both metropolitan and provincial,
should resolutely condemn; for safety as well as
goodness of shooting cannot be secured in perfection
with any barrels so constructed. I have met with
plated barrels in guns which cost the purchaser
thirty-five guineas, and I have detected them in
some of the first makers&#8217; guns; for the <em class="ital">perfection</em>
with which the fraud is accomplished is wonderful,
and few can detect it who are not strictly up to &#8220;the
dodge.&#8221; The application of a portion of sulphuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
acid into the tube at the breech end of the barrel, is
the best way of showing the fraud; for, in most cases,
it is all bored out at the thin portion of the muzzle,
and the application there would, under these circumstances,
be no test.</p>

<p>I have frequently been applied to by many masters
in the trade for advice in the recommendation of a
barrel-maker. It is at all times an invidious task
to act as a selector for individuals, and to give praise
to one man over another; more especially where the
merits of workmen approximate near to each other.
But in barrel-making, a man, to be a master of his
trade, should not only be a good workman, breeching
and filing well, but should possess a good eye in putting
barrels together (for here everything depends upon
the eye) and finishing them highly: these are only
a portion of the abilities a barrel-maker should
possess. Several of the London barrel-makers are
exceedingly good workmen, for I have tried them all;
but only converse with them, and you find the
technicalities of the work is all they can discourse
upon: the iron, the vital principle, is Greek to them;
they know nothing about it, and care less. How can
these men be guides in the right direction? They
may have seen barrels welded; but, if so, it is only
a matter of chance: even in Birmingham, where
this can be seen daily, nineteen out of twenty know
nothing theoretically. You will frequently hear them
heaping <em class="ital">anathemas</em> on a hard barrel, when floating
it, and wishing the man who invented steel barrels
&#8220;<em class="ital">in the shades below</em>.&#8221; Ask these men&#8217;s opinions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and if they expect to have the job of filing the barrels,
they will surely recommend you soft iron, stub-twist,
or charcoal-iron.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig22" id="Fig22"></a>
<img src="images/illo215.jpg" alt="Boring barrels" width="550" height="401" />
</div>

<p>Boring and grinding gun-barrels generally take
place under the same roof; the borer occupying
a very small shop, the grinder a large one. Two
men and two boys are generally found in a shop.
There are four benches, to each a spindle, in which
there is an oblong hole to receive the end of the
boring bit. The barrel is secured on a sort of
carriage, which is at liberty to traverse the whole
length of the bench. A boring bit is then selected
of suitable size; it is put into the spindle, and the
point introduced into the end of the barrel. A
sort of lever is then taken and hooked on to a kind
of staple, or a piece of hooked iron (a number of
which are fixed in one side of the bench the whole
length), and passed behind the carriage to force it up
to the bit; this is removed and fixed again, until, by
forcing up the carriage, the boring bit has passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
through the whole of the barrel. During this
operation a stream of water is kept playing on the
barrel to keep it cool. A bit, of larger dimensions,
is next introduced and passed through; then others
of still larger dimensions, until the whole of the
scales or blacks are entirely bored out; or until
the barrel has become so large in the bore, as to
preclude any further boring with safety. If the
scales are of great extent, the fault is the forger&#8217;s,
and the loss will consequently be his. If the barrels
be found perfect, they are sent back to the filer, or
he comes to inspect them, in order to ascertain
whether they be perfectly straight in the inside; if
not, to make them so.</p>

<p>The necessity of great care and attention to this
point, must be very obvious; for, if not perfectly
correct at this stage, it will require more skill and
time to get it correct afterwards than the generality
of barrel-makers are inclined to bestow.</p>

<p>When the inside has been found to be all right,
the barrel is ready for grinding. Many barrel-makers
turn their barrels entirely by self-acting
lathes, and thus obtain a correct taper from breech
end to muzzle. Experience has clearly convinced us
that this is not the best shape, but slightly hollow
towards the muzzle is preferable, as additional
weight there is decidedly injurious, and the shooting
of barrels of lighter construction is decidedly
better.</p>

<p>The generality of Birmingham barrels are ground
to the size required on large stones, which revolve at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
a terrific rate. The skill acquired by many of the
workmen is astonishing. Over and over again, have
we seen barrels coming from the mill put into the
lathe, and found almost as true as if they had been
turned. They have a method of allowing the barrel
to revolve in their hands at half the rate of the stone,
and by this means they grind them so fine that many
would be puzzled to determine whether they had been
turned or ground, were the barrel smoothed lengthways
merely to take out the marks of the stone. We
have seen the squares of a rifle barrel ground to as
perfect an octagon as the eye could assist in forming.
Best barrels are generally turned after they are
ground. Inferior barrels are struck up with a large
rubber, or smooth, by boys; in some instances by
women.</p>

<p>There is one advantage derived from grinding
barrels, namely, that the friction of the stone being
continuous, the temper of the barrel is not so much
affected as where the tool in the slide-rest is cutting
a considerable portion at once; for all barrels are
best, and superior to their compeers, which require
least metal to be either ground or turned off their
surface, as there is a density on the outer which is not
in the interior portion. The harder the material, the
less the extent of this objection.</p>

<p>To obtain the true form, it is important that they
should be turned. The way of fixing them in the
lathe is by having a number of plugs or mandrils,
which are perfectly true, and of various sizes, to fit
different bores; these are centred and put in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
lathe; a carrier is then secured on a part of the plug
that projects out of the breech-end of the barrel, and
then put into the face-plate of the lathe, which carries
it round. The leading screw that travels the slide-rest,
is then set in the angle to which the barrel is to
be turned (though some lathes have not the power of
alteration, but turn all barrels in one angle); the
slide is next adjusted to the thickness of the muzzle
wanted, and, when all is ready, the lathe is set going;
the leading screw is turned at the same moment by
the machinery connected, which keeps the tool cutting
sufficiently keen to turn a barrel in about twenty-five
minutes. This being done, nothing more is required
than a fine smooth file to remove the marks of the
tool.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt of the superiority of this
mode of turning barrels, if due care only be taken
with the tool. If it get blunted by any scales or
impurities, it is apt to tear pieces out of the barrel,
similar to the rings that may be noticed in a slovenly
bored barrel, owing to dirt getting on the edges of
the bit. In turning a barrel by a common lathe, it is
fixed in the same manner as before; about an inch of
the surface at the breech and the muzzle is turned to
the diameter wanted; the rest is then removed, and
half an inch more is turned four or five inches from
either end; then another half inch, at another distance
of four or five inches, and so on, according to
the length; making an allowance each time in the
depth of the turning, according to the taper of the
barrel. The iron between these cuttings is then filed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
off by floats the lengthways of the barrel, or more
frequently ground off; this is a sure mode of getting
the barrels perfectly straight on the outside, and
without any of those hollows and shades which may
be always discovered in an ill-made barrel. It is
astonishing how beautifully many barrels are struck
by the float. The mode of turning by the lathe is,
however, cheaper, and is now confined to military
barrels.</p>

<p>There is a great diversity of opinion as to the
proper inclination of a pair of double barrels. It
is needless to state the precise distance at which the
converging lines drawn from the centre of each barrel,
and indicating the inclination of the barrels to each
other, should come to a point. If we take the point
of convergence of those lines at 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> yards, it will
follow that, at 40 yards, each barrel, were it fixed in
a vice, would throw the centre of its charge six inches
on the opposite side of the mark fired at; but if the
gun be fired from the shoulder, the recoil will
invariably cause the gun to swerve outwards, so that
at that distance it will never fail to throw the shot in
a good direction for the mark or bull&#8217;s-eye.</p>

<p>The subject may be understood by the following
observations. All tapering substances, when laid
together were the taper extended, would come to a
point at a certain distance. Gun-barrels are made
to taper towards each other, and some more than
others. To make them uniform, it requires that
they should be reduced or flattened, so that the thick
or heavy end should join closer, to allow the point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
convergence to be extended to a greater distance. If,
then, we take two barrels two feet eight inches long,
and having a solid substance of metal at the breech
of 3-16ths of an inch each and 1-16th at the muzzle;
it requires the difference 4-16ths to be multiplied
45 times (there being that number of lengths in 40
yards) to ascertain what distance the points of the
different lines are from each other: which will be
eleven 4-16ths of an inch, or five 10-16th inches from
the centre or line of sight. If you wish to reduce it
from the centre, you have to join the barrels so much
nearer at the breech; or should the inclination be
too little, the muzzle must be jointed closer. As,
however, all guns are now made very heavy at the
breech, they very seldom require any closing at the
muzzle: though it is customary to do it, and to a
great extent; but it is owing to the ignorance of the
nature of shooting.</p>

<p>Different lengths require a difference in the height
of the rib. A greater height is also required for a
person accustomed to use a crooked stock, and less
height for one accustomed to the use of a straighter
one; and so on. Few barrels are to be met with in
which the elevation is sufficient. This is a species
of innovation much practised by gunmakers of the
present day; but whatever merit there may have
been in the original invention, there is none in &#8220;the
improvement,&#8221; as they term it. Take any of
the modern barrels, and calculate what is the real
elevation of them, and you will find it is not equal to
the distance that charges will droop at forty yards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
when we consider the very large charges of shot that
many are accustomed to use, without a corresponding
quantity of powder. It remains then to be decided
what elevation a gun should have for that distance.</p>

<p>I have tried the experiment some hundreds of
times with guns of all descriptions, both with a rest
and from the shoulder, and standing as firm as
possible; by turning quickly round, and firing (as
we might do were a bird to spring in a situation
where we could only get a snap shot) against targets
such as are used in military ball-practice, being about
six feet high, and by means of which one can perceive
where the body of the shot had struck. I have also
fired against the steep sides of sand-banks, on which,
from their smoothness, you can tell every shot that
has struck them. My conviction is, that almost all
guns charged (as is the custom) with heavy charges
of shot, droop full twelve inches in forty yards;
though by using small charges of shot you will find
them to be thrown much more correctly than the
heavy charges; so that it is possible to make a gun
too high on the rib for a shooter who thinks more
powder and less lead preferable to much lead and
little powder.</p>

<p>The elevation I have given will be found to be as
near what is requisite as possible, if we continue to
load as heretofore; if reduced charges of shot be
adopted, a less elevation will suffice. To ascertain
what elevation at the breech for the above scale
is requisite, take the thickness of the breech and
muzzle, and multiply the difference by as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
times as there are lengths of your barrels in the
forty yards, and you will then ascertain what elevation
they give of themselves; and to make up the difference
wanted, must be the elevation of the rib, which may
be calculated in the same way as the barrels; the
length of the barrels being the only way of obtaining
a correct idea of the height required. If making
woodcock guns, less elevation is required, the distance
of shooting being shorter. In large guns a
greater elevation is necessary. We believe, however,
Colonel Hawker has fallen into an error, when he
says that long guns require a greater elevation than
short ones. Does not a long gun keep the shot more
together? Is not more force generated? and is not
the initial velocity greater than in a short gun? If
these be facts, why is more elevation required if the
shot do not droop? We apprehend the Colonel means,
if the same height be required to be given above the
mark. Nothing can be plainer than this&mdash;that if
one pair of barrels be four inches longer than another,
and the elevation the same, there cannot be as many
lengths in the forty yards of the longer barrels as of
the shorter, and hence the difference when multiplied.
I think, therefore, he cannot have taken into consideration
the superiority in their shooting; for there
cannot be a doubt that, if a gun keep the shot
together longer, it cannot require that allowance for
drooping which a shorter gun does.</p>

<p>As soon as the barrels are properly jointed; care
must be taken to see that they are perfectly level. If
the barrels are not level, it will be impossible to shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
correctly, as one barrel will throw the shot above, the
other below the mark. This being done, the barrels
are bound together and brazed with hard solder or
brass, for about four or five inches. Greater injury
cannot be done to barrels than by this pernicious
practice; for they cannot be brazed without being
heated to a white heat; and by this heat all the
advantages derived from hammering are dissipated at
once: the condensation is gone, and the strength is
reduced at least 12<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent. And for what purpose?
Under the pretence that the barrels are firmer
and not so liable to become loose. This is a point
trivial in importance compared to the excellence
and strength of the barrel; for even if they have
received no more hammering than is necessary in the
forging, they are still injured to the extent of 12<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
per cent.: for even beating them when hot improves
them much, provided they be not heated again; but
if they have been cold hammered, the injury is full
30 per cent. This circumstance shows how little the
principles of gun-making are understood by the first
gun-makers, the brazing of barrels being practised
by all.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkinson admits this, for he says&mdash;&#8220;The
practice of brazing the barrels is decidedly injurious,
by softening that part more than the other; but if
they were only soft soldered, the inconvenience would
be far greater, as the barrels would be liable to some
accident by the repeated expansion and contraction
that takes place in firing, as well as by the force
required to turn out the breechings.&#8221; I can only say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that I have had considerably more than five thousand
pairs of barrels made and put together with soft
solder only, and not one pair has come asunder from
any of the causes mentioned; nor ever will, with fair
play. On the contrary, barrels brazed can never be
sound; for at some distance from the part heated
for brazing, you cannot get the barrels re-tinned
effectually, and thus for a considerable space between
the soft and hard solder, there is no cohesion at all.
Barrels brazed together only for three or four inches
at the breech-end, can never be sound: they almost
invariably become so rusted under the rib, in a few
years, as both to seriously injure the barrels, and force
the rib upwards; therefore, if you hard solder at all,
do so from breech to muzzle, as that will be preferable
to partially doing it. I feel quite satisfied, and can
prove it to demonstration, that this is undoubtedly
the most injurious process to which iron can be
subjected; and I believe the prejudice with which
the London barrel-makers stick to this practice is
productive of considerable injury to them: more especially
when we recollect that they are the advocates
(in practice) of a very inferior quality of Damascus
barrels: an iron very susceptible of injury. The
Belgian barrels, and French also, are of good iron;
and I fear not contradiction in asserting their inferiority
to English barrels mostly consists in the
foolish practice of brazing them together from end
to end. Both chemically and mechanically it is a
practice for which no valid excuse can be offered.</p>

<p>All barrels should have solid ribs for at least eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
inches from the breech: they tend to lessen the
vibration of recoil, as well as to render the barrels
more sound and firm. No maker either understands
science or studies quality, who advocates brazing and
hollow ribs.</p>

<p>The invention of the patent breech was the emanation
of a scientific mind; for it has been productive
of more real benefit to the progress of gunnery than
any other improvement of the last two centuries.
Experience and study in the theory of guns and
gunpowder, give the mind a much more enlarged
view of the subject, if regulated by the established
laws of true and sound principles: a want of
thorough knowledge induces the individual to draw
conclusions prematurely, and thus he is apt to fall,
and to lead others, into error. I confess, that, together
with many hundreds more, I once concluded
that the great advantage of the patent breech arose
entirely from the loose state in which the powder
was preserved while in the breech, and its thus
being more instantaneously ignited. But I have
already shown that the quickness of powder is, in
a great measure, the greatest drawback to its efficacy,
and I am clearly convinced that compression, in most
instances, is beneficial, by retarding the ignition to
a certain extent. Here, then, is proof positive, that
we have been on the wrong scent, and running after
a &#8220;Will o&#8217; the Wisp.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig23" id="Fig23"></a>
<img src="images/illo226.jpg" alt="Sections of conical breeches, double barrel" width="300" height="343" />
</div>

<p>There is the clearest evidence, that the only advantage
to be derived from any conical form of
breech, does not arise from any peculiarity attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to the ignition of the gunpowder, but solely from
the effect of the angular shape; conical form being
best suited, or presenting the least direct surface,
to the action of the exploded fluid: the angles
receive the blow and throw it off at the same opposite
angle, and so on, without receiving any amount
of force from the element striking it, and thus the
elastic fluid is enabled to be resisted efficaciously.
The cone becomes and forms an artificial solid base,
to a certain extent; and as such, it is much more
beneficial than the same quantity of powder ignited
on a flat surface&mdash;as a common plug breech, for instance;
for here the direct quantity of space on the
face of the breech receives the same impulse as the
ball projected, and is acted upon in precisely the
same ratio in proportion to their different weights.
In a musket of 11 lbs., the comparative weight of
gun and ball is as 1 to 176; and exactly in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
proportion will be the distribution of impulse from
the expellant fluid. It thus becomes a plain question
between the patent breech and the flat surface of
the plug. The two halves of a parabola inverted,
or the shape of a parabolic spindle, will be the best
shape, according to the laws of science. The <a href="#Fig23">representation</a>
given on page 209 is as near as I can get
the engraver to represent my views of the best shape
of breech.</p>

<p>A great variety of forms have been advocated and
puffed; some of them of the most unscientific description
possible: but it matters not; for if a
zealous advocate could be found to puff well the
advantages of the old matchlock, he would find
believers; so prone are mankind to be deluded by
the veriest quackery. The absurdity of exploding
gunpowder in a <em class="ital">shell</em> at the breech of a gun, and
persisting in the advantage of it, is certainly tilting
at a windmill. It will be asked how it is that
Government do not adopt the patent breech in the
musket? I answer, because of a want of science in
the direction, and an imperfect system of experiments.
In fact, they say they do not find any advantage from
the patent breech in a musket: that the range is as
great without it as with it.</p>

<p>Government never considers the personal comfort
of the private soldier, or it would have long ago
used the patent breech for military arms; for, setting
aside the propellant advantage, the recoil is (as near
as I have been able to ascertain) under the same
circumstances, as one to two in favour of the angular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
breech. This is no exaggerated statement: I have
tested it, and will stake my reputation upon its
accuracy. But the superior knowledge of projectiles
which artillerists have obtained since the extensive
introduction of chambers to nearly all descriptions
of ordnance, is the clearest proof, were any wanting.
The use of the Gomer form of chamber, is nearly
universal in brass guns: the shape is the frustum of
a cone with a spherical bottom. The inutility of
enlarging on, or describing, the various shapes or
plans of breeching, will be apparent; my intention
being to point out the science of the question, not
the folly of every invention.</p>

<p>There have been many good gun-lock makers; but
they have, I fear, decreased much of late. From
the great demand for second-rate goods, they are
rarely called upon to make a first-rate article; and
thus, from being so little accustomed to make any
but inferior locks, they, of course, are out of practice.
Instead of the manufacture of the best being
encouraged, it is becoming every day more rare to
meet with a good one. There is a great degree of
skill displayed in the making of locks, though to the
casual observer it is not apparent. On the simple
hanging of the swivel depends all the smoothness of
the play of the main-spring; and on the placing the
hole for the scear-pin depends the sweetness of the
scear playing on the tumbler. Many who now pass
for excellent workmen would find this a difficult
undertaking, simple as it may seem, without a
pattern by which to work. All locks for percussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
should have the greatest strength of mainspring
at the moment they strike the nipple, or
as it is termed, when the lock is down. On the
pitching the scear depends the cutting of the bents,
and on their formation, the danger of the lock
catching at half-cock, when the trigger is made to
pull easy; but these observations will be understood
by a lock-maker better than I can explain them.</p>

<p>The quality of all locks depends on the price they
cost filing, and unless you pay the workman a proper
remuneration, you may rely on having them somewhat
inferior, or in accordance with the price: but
this requires a workman to point out; so that any
person who is not a first-rate judge, is completely
dependent on the honesty of the workman.</p>

<p>There is more real science displayed in the construction
of a gun-lock than mechanics in general
imagine. The placing or hanging of the swivel on
the arm of a tumbler, is an arrangement of leverage
partaking of the multiplicate; as the weight when at
full cock, is lessened by the lever bringing the moving
force in the immediate vicinity of the axle, and when
down on the nipple, increasing or multiplying that
force by the divergence. The Barside lock possesses
this advantage to a greater degree than has yet been
obtained by any backwork lock yet made; though I
perceive no hindrance, if properly understood and
tried: it is only needful to obtain a greater length of
arm, and a proportionate length of swivel.</p>

<p>The family of the Braziers, of Wolverhampton,
have long been celebrated for the goodness of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
locks; which arises solely from the fact that they
take more pains, and will not manufacture any but
the best: for it would be ridiculous to suppose that
there are not plenty of men equally as good, and
probably better, workmen than themselves in the kingdom,
were they properly encouraged, and confined to
making nothing but first-rate articles. The Braziers
have apprentices and journeymen, and it is preposterous
to imagine that they file the tenth part of the
locks they furnish to the trade; but yet they have
always, and deservedly, obtained a much better price
than any other lock-filers out of London. Several
of Brazier&#8217;s workmen have of late years commenced
manufacturing on their own account, and now most
excellent locks can be had from W. Evans, of Bath-street,
Birmingham, who for many years held the first
place in Joseph Brazier and Sons&#8217; manufactory.</p>

<p>The operations of false breeching, jointing locks,
stocking, &amp;c., are merely mechanical; requiring, certainly,
great skill and ability, but yet involving no
principle further than is contained in the proper
suiting of the shape to the make of the user. An
endless variety of opinions has always existed, and
always will exist, as to the description of bend or crook
best fitted for rapid shooting, as flying or running.
I have instructed, and with success, too, many young
shooters, who by commencing with a long and straight
stock, have attained a perfection in shooting scarcely
to be excelled; and they never entertain afterwards
any wish to change either length or bend. Therefore
I recommend to all beginners to use as long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and as straight a stock as they can <em class="ital">conveniently</em> bring
to the shoulder. All practised shooters have generally
so accustomed themselves to one shape, that it
would be prejudicial to change. The practice of
throwing off a stock at the butt, or bending from the
hand to the heel-plate, in a direction to the right, so
that the eye may get more readily in a line with the
centre of the breech and the sight, is a practice not
to be defended on scientific principles. The body
will suit itself best; and if the stock be not too
straight, the eye will always find the true line.</p>

<p>The percussioning of a gun (as the fitting-in of
nipple, boring breeches, filing cocks, &amp;c., is termed,)
is also a mechanical operation, requiring workmen
of the very best abilities. The desideratum to be
obtained is nearly a direct communication into the
barrel, and an absence of unnecessary angles, antechambers,
&amp;c.; therefore it is needful that, in a
double gun, the nipples should be inserted as near
the centre of the breeches as they can be conveniently
placed, with the nipples standing, not upright, but
at an angle of 45&deg;; so that the blow of the cock
shall be in or as near a line with the imaginary
upright of the nipple as possible.</p>

<p>The various plans of copper cap, copper tubes, and
I know not how many other devices, will be discussed
under the head of <a href="#Page_435">guns and shooting</a>.</p>

<p>Finishing the stock, polishing, engraving, hardening,
&amp;c., strictly speaking, involve no science of consequence,
and as such it is scarcely necessary to
occupy the attention of the reader respecting them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
The best method of staining barrels is by the following
recipe: but one material fact must not be
overlooked. A considerable difficulty exists in staining
barrels all steel; in such a case, therefore, the
acid should not be so much diluted.</p>

<table class="nowrap" summary="Table page 215">

</table>

<p>These are to be well mixed, and allowed to stand
a month, to amalgamate. After the oil or grease
has been removed from the barrels by lime, the mixture
is laid on lightly with a sponge every two hours.
It should be scratched off with a steel-wire brush
night and morning, until the barrels are dark
enough; and then the acid is destroyed by pouring
on the barrels boiling water, and continuing to rub
them till nearly cool.</p>

<p>The Birmingham people brown their barrels of
inferior quality in the following way, to make them
look equal to the best. They dissolve as much
muriate of mercury as can be taken up in a dram-glassful
of spirits of wine; this solution is mixed with
one pint of water, or as much diluted as the person
requires. A small quantity of the mixture is poured
on a little whitening, and laid on the barrel with a
sponge, rather lightly; as soon as dry, it is brushed
off, and a fresh coat is laid on; and so on until the
barrel is dark enough, which is generally about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
days. The effect that the mercury has on every one
of the joints of the fibres is wonderful: it never fails
to make them, in two or three days at most, a
beautiful brown; while the other parts, being harder,
remain, comparatively speaking, quite light. The
rust is killed by hot water, but after that, the barrels
are suddenly immersed in cold water; which has the
effect of heightening the brightness of both the
colours. The appearance is beautiful, and equally
as fine to the eye as stub-barrels browned in the
same way; though this process is mostly used for
the charcoal iron and the threepenny iron barrels.
The only method in which there is no deception,
is the smoke brown or stain; and, plainly speaking,
this and no other is the reason the gun-makers
condemn it. As the acid is decidedly weaker, and
of course less liable to impart injury to the iron,
no barrel can be browned by it, to look well and
fine, but the best; or, in other words, none save
those possessing steel in their composition.</p>

<p>The method of staining is this: the barrels are
anointed with a little vitriolic acid, to cause the iron
to receive the effect of the gas more readily; it is
then washed off, and the barrels rubbed dry. The
forge fire must then be lighted, and blown up with
coal possessing as much hydrogen gas and as little
sulphur as possible. When the coals are burnt till
they give out a clear white flame with no black smoke
around it, the barrels must be passed gradually
through that flame backward and forward, until
the whole are covered with a black sooty covering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Place them in as damp and cool a cellar as can
be procured, and allow them to stand for eighteen
hours; at that time, if the place is sufficiently
damp, the iron parts will be found covered with a
red rust, while the particles of steel still retain the
original sooty coat. Scratch these off with a steel
brush, the same as by any other method of staining;
then take a piece of linen cloth, and wash or polish
the barrels with water and a little washed emery;
when the steel will be found of its original bright
colour, and the iron a shade darker, with the outlines
of both distinctly preserved. Rub the barrels dry,
and again pass them through the flame precisely as
before; but above all things be careful not to allow
them to remain in the flame till they become hot
enough to melt the solder. When you have once
passed them through, do not be in a hurry to pass
them again; but in both be guided by moderation:
neither allow them, after the first time, to stand
to rust more than twelve hours each time. Polish
them as before, and you will find them a shade
darker at every smoking. Persevere, until they become
as dark as you wish to have them. The utmost
you can obtain is a fine purple-black colour on the
iron; and on the steel, a shade inclined to a copper
colour: but if proper attention be paid to the
polishing, it will not change much from its original
colour.</p>

<p>The barrels are taken out of stain in the same
way as in the other recipes, by hot water; but you
must continue to scratch or brush them longer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
for by that means you obtain a greater gloss. The
principle of this stain is simply thus: the hydrogen
gas contained in the coal acting on the iron (from
being of a softer nature than the steel, which it does
not affect), and the flame also possessing a quantity
of tar, it is imperceptibly embodied by the iron
during the action of the oxide; and, when finished,
by filling up the spaces created, it becomes decidedly
more impervious to damp or wet than the other
stain, which is entirely composed of the oxide of
iron.</p>

<p>The only objection to this brown has been found
to arise from the discharge of the black colour from
the softer parts of the barrels; as it being but coal tar,
the sweat of the hand, hot water in washing, &amp;c.,
invariably extract it in a comparatively short time.</p>

<p>The recipe, for the Birmingham imitations, is as

<p>When the barrels are dark enough, drop a few
drops of muriatic acid in a basin of water, and wash
the barrel slightly, to brighten the twists.</p>

<p>This last process is borrowed from the Belgians.
In the working of their extremely fine Damascus
barrels, they found a very great difficulty in staining
them so as to produce a clear and distinct figure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
The way they now proceed is either to eat away the
particles of iron, leaving the steel prominent and
the barrels bright; or they polish them extremely fine
from end to end, and then blue them in a stove with
charcoal. The process is thus described in the notes
to a German translation, by Dr. Schmidt, of Weimar,
of my last edition of the &#8220;Science of Gunnery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The method of browning the Damascus barrels,
which are so much admired in England for their
distinctness in colour and beauty of figure, is obtained
very simply: namely, first burnish the barrels very
fine; then cover them with bone oil; pound, or drop,
or strew wood-ashes all over; then heat them in a
cage of wire filled with charcoal, until you obtain a
dark first blue; after they are cold, mix a small
quantity of sulphuric acid in water (a quarter of a
pint with so many drops); then take a hard brush
and apply it to the barrel, when the acid will extract
the colour from the steel, leaving the iron with its
greater adhesion covered with the blue colour. Great
care must be used and skill displayed to keep a good
colour and not to extract too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>This we cannot do, because we solder with tin.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Belgian Damascus&#8221; barrels are generally
&#8220;eat up,&#8221; as it is technically termed. &#8220;Pickled&#8221;
is the term also used to describe the process, which
is simply eating away the softer metals from around
the steel or harder material. The best preparation
for this purpose is 1 lb. of the sulphate of copper
(known as blue vitriol) dissolved in a gallon of soft
water, at the boiling point, and continued boiling in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
an earthenware vessel, until the quantity is reduced
by evaporation 25 per cent.; let it cool, and then
pour it into a leaden trough or bath. The barrels,
when properly secured at the muzzle and breech-ends
to prevent the liquid getting into the interior, are
immersed therein. The solution will act sufficiently
upon the metals in the space of from fifteen to
twenty minutes; care being taken to remove and
carefully wash them with cold water, and then, after
observing the progress of the <em class="ital">pickling</em>, re-immersing
them as before, until the operation is complete.
Then pour boiling water over them, and scratch them
well with a steel brush, which will eventually give
that beautiful bright &#8220;wavy&#8221; surface much admired
by many people. Laminated steel barrels also look
very well, after being subjected to this operation.</p>

<p>Having now detailed as much of the &#8220;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</i>,&#8221; as the patience of the reader will admit,
I shall endeavour to give a peep into the &#8220;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum
sanctorum</i>&#8221; of the gun-makers&#8217; workshop. I have
shown in detail what course ought to be pursued
in the construction of guns of the best quality
only; and before proceeding further shall finish this
part of the subject. I am not, as some would say,
&#8220;going to expose the <em class="ital">whole</em> secrets of the trade:&#8221;
oh no, only a portion.</p>

<p>There are six qualities or varieties of mixtures of
iron for barrels of best quality. The plate-facing
contains two kinds finished, composed of steel entirely,
but of different degrees of carbonization; one is composed
entirely of a laminated series containing many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
scores of distinct lamin&aelig; in the thickness of the sides
of the barrels, twisted and beat into tortuous shapes.
The other, of larger lamin&aelig;, but showing the edges
of the lamin&aelig; at an angle with the length, and
thus appearing larger than, if presenting the side or
end of the plates.</p>

<p>Care must be taken that the great proportion of
the fibres shall always run round the tube, so that the
greatest portion of strength may be obtained, together
with a beautiful figure. The cost of this arrangement
is considerable, as it involves a great waste of
metal, and occupies a considerable time to work and
re-work&mdash;twisting, faggoting with the bars placed in
various forms, at acute angles to each other, at right
angles, plaiting three or four rods together, as a lady
does her hair, cutting these into pieces, faggoting and
welding them into one, and, in short, undergoing an
endless routine of manipulations, which it would be
strictly unprofitable to detail, but are all productive
of cost. An ingenious man may work and improve
metal of this nature until its cost equals the price
of silver; and, if judiciously done, improving it still,
even until he has wasted 90 per cent. of the original
material.</p>

<p>The ultimate characteristics and properties of iron
have, as yet, never been ascertained: it is capable of
being condensed until it becomes nearly, if not quite,
equal to the specific gravity of silver or lead. No
pursuit, mechanical or philosophical, presents so great
and so beneficial a research, to the whole civilized and
scientific world, as iron. I could twist and retwist iron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
until, from the beautiful and interesting results, it
would become with me a sort of monomania. I
wonder not at the variety of patterns in a Damascus
sword-blade: the mind conveys me to the scene, and
a regret arises that I did not live in those times; yet
still it is but a mechanical arrangement directed by
an ingenious mind, and the ultimate benefit, apart
from the beauty, is more than imaginary. However,
it proves that the Orientals were artists, and
that they were appreciated: were this the case now
with us, we could do all they ever did, and more.</p>

<p>Laminated steel is now a great fact. It is a name
stereotyped in Belgium, Germany, France, and America,
as well as in the place of its birth&mdash;England;
and orders come from all quarters of the globe for the
celebrated laminated steel. Every writer of eminence
is loud in its praise, and justly so too; for about its
merits there is no mistake. No combination of metals
ever yet before tried since the birth of gunnery, can
equal it, either in density, ductility, or tenacity. A
laminated steel barrel has never been known to burst.
&#8220;Reputed&#8221; laminated steel barrels have been burst,
but no real one ever. Nor is it probable, save from
malconstruction. Through inattention in the welding
the best of metal may be burnt; but the better
the iron, the greater the difficulty. Steel is more
liable to melt than burn; so that, with care and
skill on the part of the workman, it will very
seldom indeed occur. But that chance is provided
for, as far as human judgment can do, in entrusting
such barrels only to first-rate and steady workmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Such men are no doubt, to a certain extent, scarce;
but they may yet be found: the Birmingham welder
of proved skill and ability is inferior to none in the
world. Laminated steel barrels are more scarce than
welders.</p>

<p>Although the various manufacturers of Europe
have complimented me by adopting the name of
my invention, yet I am sorry to add it is but in
name: there are very few even tolerable imitations of
them. The cost is the &#8220;bugbear:&#8221; the name costs
nothing, and can easily be assumed; but to make
laminated steel barrels is quite another matter: it
touches the pocket, and interferes with the profit;
and it is only in very rare cases indeed&mdash;although the
order may be explicit as words can make it&mdash;that the
real article is supplied. There are very few makers
in Birmingham who in reality make &#8220;laminated
steel.&#8221; Steel barrels are more plentiful: they care
not so much for the price of the metal; it is the after
repeated manipulations that are evaded: the labour
and loss of material is too much, and is necessarily
&#8220;shirked,&#8221; and argument is always met with the
answer, &#8220;We see nothing in it.&#8221; Yet the words
&#8220;laminated steel&#8221; are to be found engraved upon
barrels of the lowest quality of iron of which double
barrels are made. Iron twist is subjected to a similar
process to that already described as employed in producing
Damascus iron, and which may be termed
common iron Damascus. Thousands of guns are
made from this kind of metal, and yearly sent to the
United States of America; yet all are unblushingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
represented as &#8220;laminated steel barrels.&#8221; The actual
price charged for these sort of guns in the United
States I know not, but have no doubt for the whole
gun it is about equal to what would be the prime
cost of a pair of real laminated steel barrels alone.</p>

<p>Purchasers should be fully acquainted with the
fact that it is impossible to produce laminated steel
barrels at a low figure: labour, high-priced, skilled
labour, is always costly; and talent must be paid for
in all parts of the world. The attainment of high
class barrels at a low figure, as a rule, is an impossibility;
and the maker who would pretend, promise,
or undertake to make a laminated steel barrelled gun
under 15<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr> to 20<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr> is an arrant deceiver: he could
never profitably carry out such an intention, even if
he possessed the ability to produce the article. For
judgment, skill, and ability, as well as labour, are
required to produce laminated steel barrels. Steel
alone is not laminated; and that is another difficulty:
fortunately there are not many persons capable of
effecting it. My method of laminating steel is kept
as much out of sight as possible, as a means of
self-protection.</p>

<p>Stub Damascus is by many makers called &#8220;steel:&#8221;
both first and second class stub; and any attempt to
reason them out of the absurdity is a hopeless task.
Many of the highest class makers still doggedly stick
to stub Damascus, and insinuate underhandedly that
the benefit of steel is doubtful: few do it openly;
but I feel sorry to record the fact that prejudice on
this point is still rampant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>On the superior shooting properties of steel barrels
I will enlarge in another place.</p>

<p>The Exhibitions have told very beneficially on the
future of Birmingham; the fact of standing highest
in every competition will do (and has done) more to
remove the prejudice entertained against Birmingham
manufacture than aught beside. Sportsmen begin to
understand the fact that it is better to order their
guns direct from the manufacturer than from the
mere salesman, who can only take his goods on trust,
and warrants without knowing that he can justly do
so. Any system that would identify the maker with
his work would do all that is necessary to emancipate
Birmingham from the stigma which prejudice has
entailed upon her name; and from which I hope to
see her rise rapidly yet. But I do not wish to see
her rise on the reputation of London: would that all
Birmingham guns were like those of London makers;
or superior to them, if possible.</p>

<p>In addition to the serious evil of producing guns of
such great inferiority in material, and dubbing such
barrels &#8220;laminated steel,&#8221; a far more serious one is
the practice of unscrupulously adding to such guns
the names of makers who have spent the majority of
their lives in obtaining a name for their manufacture;
thus robbing them indirectly of what is dear
to all honest men&mdash;reputation. Few are judges
sufficiently qualified to detect a spurious gun of
this description; and the name thus forged reflects
unmerited discredit on a maker who would scorn to
allow such an article to leave his manufactory: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
as long as the standard of moral honesty is so low,
both among merchants and manufacturers, such
things will be. Men may excuse themselves for
affixing the names of men and firms to inferior or
worthless guns by the plea of having been ordered
to do it by the exporters, but they are not the less
doing a moral wrong, in thus aiding in a deception
which profits them not. But such practices will
continue, until the sense of right and wrong becomes
more conscientious, and trade morality rises to a
higher standard than at present.</p>

<p>I have every reason to believe, and have not the
least hesitation in stating the fact, that not only is
the epithet &#8220;laminated steel&#8221; added to guns the
barrels of which do not contain a particle of steel,
but that a far more serious misrepresentation and
injury is perpetrated by affixing the words &#8220;William
Greener&#8217;s Laminated Steel, indestructible by Gunpowder,&#8221;
to many guns not even of middling fair
quality, but the veriest rubbish ever manufactured.
That this is a species of forgery there can be no
doubt; yet the law of this country affords no remedy
to effectually prevent and punish the rascality of
offering for sale an article fraudulently professing to
be what it is not, to the injury of the purchaser as
well as the manufacturer whose good name is thus
maligned. Forged &#8220;Greener&#8217;s&#8221; are to be found principally
in the American markets; where batches of
ten and twelve have been seen in various parts of the
States, principally in the hands of &#8220;itinerant merchants.&#8221;
They are, I believe, pretty plentifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
produced in &#8220;Liege,&#8221; also; where, in fact, forgeries
on all our principal makers are produced.</p>

<p>As the law provides no effectual remedy or punishment
for such rascality, I now, in order to lessen it
as much as possible, mark every gun leaving my
manufactory with a &#8220;<em class="ital">private mark</em>&#8221; in addition to
its number; and on reference to me, giving a description
of the gun purchased &#8220;and its number,&#8221; information
will be returned of the private mark, which will
stamp the article as real or spurious. If the gun has
no number reference is useless, as I number every gun
that I send out, and the want is certain proof that it is
a forgery. But with a view to lessen the evil as much
as can be, I may here say that the best double gun,
with case complete, that I can make will be freely
given to any individual who will produce evidence
which will enable me to expose all parties concerned
in such nefarious dealing, and justify me in holding
them up to public reprobation: which will be done as
certainly as proof can be adduced.</p>

<p>There are ample fields of commerce in gunnery
yet to be developed, were articles produced suitable
for use, not for show or deception. Inferiority of
manufacture combined with deception is the worst
course ever adopted by any community. If Birmingham
would repudiate such a course, and refuse to
make worthless articles, attending more to quality
than cheapness, the gun trade would be more prosperous
than it ever has been.</p>

<p>Time is rapidly realising the recommendations I
have put forth of the great benefit to be obtained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
not only in steam boilers, but various other mechanical
constructions, by the use of higher qualities of
metals. We have now even &#8220;steel ships&#8221; as well as
steel guns, giving double the strength, with half the
weight; and if all manufacturers of high class
machines adopted the same principles, an immense
saving would be effected in the long run, from the
absence of repairs alone, in addition to the greater
durability of the machine.</p>

<p>There ought to be no accidents from the breaking
of railway carriage axles: such an occurrence as the
breaking of an axle is an everlasting disgrace; for
axles could be constructed that no known &#8220;fair
application&#8221; of strain could possibly break. A simple
combination of steel and iron faggoted in segments,
as before described, and rolled hollow, would enable
axles to last double the time of those at present
in use: 40,000 miles travelling is stated to be the
maximum distance an axle can be safely trusted; the
destruction being mainly due to the heating in the
journals, or to galvanic action changing the fibrous
iron into crystalline in the immediate vicinity of the
bearing. Axles constructed of different metals, as
steel and iron in conjunction, would not be so
affected; and might be rendered still less likely to
be so by a small hollow in the centre of the axle.
But this is a digression; though I may be pardoned for
it, in consideration of the importance of the subject.</p>

<p>The opposite <a href="#Plate2">plate (No. 2)</a> represents my mixture in
imitation of Damascus; the process necessary to produce
it, as well as its companion, has already been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
described. These two also come under the head
of best barrels, as they are costly, and when honestly
made (not plated) constitute, with the defects before
enumerated, good barrels.</p>

<p>The cost of a really good first-rate gun must and
will always vary, according to the circumstances of
manufacture or the peculiar arrangements of the
manufacturer. Joseph Manton is entitled to the
gratitude, not only of the present generation of gun-makers,
but of all succeeding ones, for this reason,&mdash;he
not only gave a character to English guns, but
so linked his name with improvements, that it will
never be forgotten. His was the mind to know
and appreciate the value of good workmanship; he
elevated the English artisan with himself, and raised
the gunmaker to the acme of mechanical skill: for,
without invidious comparison of the ability required
in other professions, we may say that a first-rate
workman as a <em class="ital">gun-maker</em><a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (<em class="ital">I mean only a gun-maker</em>)
is one of the very best mechanics England
can boast of, or in truth any part of the world.
Gun-making is the profession of a man of mind:
any man or any workman cannot make a gun,
working by square and rule entirely, as other
mechanics do: no, the true <em class="ital">gun-maker</em> is an artist,
and Joe Manton made him so.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Barrel welders, borers, lock-filers, &amp;c., are not technically
gun-makers: the latter are those workmen who, having barrels,
locks, wood for stock, &amp;c., make them into a gun. It has been
customary to say gunsmiths; but this appellation can be applied to
the worker in iron only.</p></div>

<p>It is true, we have not now that complex machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the flint-lock gun, in which Joe so peculiarly excelled;
but we have a more simple and a more efficacious
one in the percussion gun. He was not so fortunate
in the latter as the former; but all men are at fault
sometimes, and he could not be expected to fondle
the child of another: no, it was for the first improvement
of the <em class="ital">workmanship</em> of the gun, that his memory
must be revered. The English gun, at the outset
of his career, was as far inferior to what he left it,
as the tawdry manufacture of the continent is to
ours of the present day. The prices he obtained
were enormous certainly; but all men should be
paid well, who can prove they possess extra brains
and ability: he remunerated his workmen on this
scale, and he unquestionably had the best set the
world ever saw. We can, at this period, far excel
them, for the <em class="ital">pupil</em> sometimes exceeds the <em class="ital">tutor</em>;
but this arises from laying firmly the foundation of a
superior system.</p>

<p>All my ambition has been to be able to make an
article that cannot be exceeded in goodness and
neatness, combined with taste, by the generation in
which we live. In proof of this success I may mention
that the two First Class Prize Medals in the
Great Exhibition of 1851; two more in 1853 at
New York; and, lastly, two at Paris in 1855,
were awarded to me.</p>

<p>The best gun, or as good a one as ever was constructed,
or ever will be, should yield the maker a
profit at 35<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr> Cheaper it cannot be made, if it be
<em class="ital">honestly the best</em>. I have studied and estimated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
cost both of town and country-made guns, and am
aware that the London maker would be barely
remunerated at this rate, owing to the extra expenses
he is liable to. But I also know, without doubt,
that as good guns can be, and have been, made in
Birmingham as ever were produced in London: the
facilities Birmingham possesses will always tell in
that competition. Westley Richards is an example;
for not much better guns can be manufactured than
he produces daily, as most London gun-makers full
well know. Let but some individual, with the head
and the <em class="ital">cash</em>, try the experiment of making guns
himself at Birmingham, and a fortune would be the
result; as better workmen, if well looked after,
cannot be found in the world. But their talents are
now prostituted in the production of inferior articles;
and when wanted are, of course, <em class="ital">amiss</em> for any great
effort. Birmingham is a workshop where if one
tool does not suit you you can get another: if a
barrel be faulty, or locks inferior, you can have a
new one in the time a London house would take in
ordering it. These remarks are not dictated by any
feeling of dislike to the metropolitan makers, but
from a conviction of their truth. Establishments
like Joe Manton&#8217;s are not met with in London
now-a-days&mdash;not one house in the business can maintain
them.</p>

<p>I cannot possibly have any wish to depreciate.
What benefit would be gained by it? But I cannot
praise the London manufacturer against conviction;
and I am unfortunately too much in the secret: I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
know too well where and how the vast majority of
London guns are made. Why keep up a distinction
that does not exist? Why call a gun London-made
because the seller rents a shop and calls himself a gun-maker?
Why not at once say, &#8220;Our manufactory is in
Birmingham, as we find we can make both better and
cheaper there.&#8221; This is truth, and ought to be told.
It is now the extreme of folly to say, &#8220;These are
<em class="ital">Brummagem</em> guns:&#8221; that term only applies to the
&#8220;<em class="ital">rubbish</em>,&#8221; the low priced article, which no honest
man has hardihood enough to brand with his own
name, but substitutes that of some deceased member
of the <em class="ital">fraternity</em>. But when sensible London tradesmen
so far forget themselves as to designate the
produce of a &#8220;<em class="ital">brother chip</em>&#8221; as &#8220;only Birmingham
guns,&#8221; without ever having seen or examined that work,
<em class="ital">I feel sensitive on the point</em>; for though the term is
strictly correct, yet the meaning is slanderous.</p>

<p>I have always written and impressed upon sportsmen
the imperative necessity of obtaining the very
best gun that hands could produce; I urged this
sincerely, and for doing so feel myself entitled to the
gratitude of all gunmakers who delight in good work.
Yet instead of the merit of my work being appreciated,
I have unfortunately had to contend with the secret
revilings of those who possess not the heart or ability
to compete with me. &#8220;A fair field and no favour&#8221;
has ever been my motto; and, without egotism, I can
safely offer to make a gun or guns against any maker
in the world. I do not claim this ability exclusively;
for I can name several in Birmingham, who, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
have the price, will not be far behind. I may fearlessly
point to the fact that throughout the whole
breadth of England every gunmaker is a copyist of
my patterns. Three months after the opening of the
Paris Exhibition, imitations were found in every gun-maker&#8217;s
shop in Paris, labelled, &#8220;Fusils de chasse a
l&#8217;Anglais.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both the Belgians and French are making vast
strides in competition with us. In Liege they have
very recently purchased guns by most of our celebrated
makers as models; and every part of the gun
is being imitated to the greatest nicety. I have before
alluded to twenty-six of Westley Richards&#8217; guns, forgeries,
having been sent to London; in truth they have
taken us as a model, and if we do not <em class="ital">keep going ahead</em>,
depend upon it we shall be hard run. In every
respectable maker&#8217;s shop abroad you will find proof of
this fact. I brought to England several specimens of
their productions, and amongst others a pair of imitation
&#8220;Braziers&#8217; locks;&#8221; these have been shown to
many makers in Birmingham, and pronounced unanimously
a fair pair of locks: indeed no workman in the
kingdom but would have taken them to be of English
manufacture. In Paris they carry their imitation, <em class="ital">if
possible</em>, farther still. I saw in Le Page&#8217;s establishment
some very good work indeed, and said so;
remarking that they were very <em class="ital">little inferior</em> to our
best English guns. &#8220;<em class="ital">Inferior</em>, indeed!&#8221; said he,
&#8220;we consider them quite as good, I assure you:&#8221;
showing evidently a wish to <em class="ital">have them as good</em>. The
French may excel us in the laudable desire to improve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Their periodical Exposition is a proof of
this. We should have our &#8220;Exposition&#8221; also. Look
at the national importance it would give to our artists
in all metals! how many bright men would then
spring into notice! what an impetus it gives to competition.
Artists and sculptors exhibit the effects of
their genius: why should not gunmakers also? The
highest skill is required in producing a gun: a first-rate
gun is indeed a work of art. Why is it not
done? &#8220;Self&#8221; is the stumbling-block. The first
makers &#8220;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>&#8221; do not encourage it, being
jealous of being beaten by some provincial. There
wants unanimity, a co-operative feeling, both in
London and Birmingham. A well-arranged &#8220;Mutual
Improvement Society&#8221; would be the means of driving
the &#8220;<em class="ital">rubbish</em>&#8221; out of the market, and the sordid
manufacturer into a reformation of his ways; it would
show him that honesty in his manufactures is as
essential as honesty in his outward dealings. I lament
that this untoward feeling should exist; more especially
in Birmingham, where they possess all the elements
for future prosperity: but these are blighted, from the
want of an expansive, liberal feeling to each other. I
hope to see this state of things attained soon: the
seeds of improvement are taking root.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Plate3">plate (No. 3)</a> opposite represents stub twist and
stub Damascus; the former, if properly attended to
in manufacture, will long hold its station in the construction
of good guns. An excellent second-rate
gun can be made for about 20<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr>, with case, &amp;c. At
this time there are a great number made at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
price: in fact, very few cost more; even those of the
best production of Birmingham. Superior articles to
any yet produced could be made there, if occasion
demanded it, and if there were a sufficiency of heads
to direct and control. The generality of gunmakers
in Birmingham are merely mechanics, and when you
say this, all has been said that can be: a vast majority
of excellent workmen have never fired a gun, and
know nothing, strictly speaking, of its use. A gunmaker,
in the true meaning of the word, is, or ought
to be, an enthusiast; delighting in, and living for,
his art alone; without being clogged with prejudice
or with a stubborn mind that refuses to advance, but
animated by a spirit to conceive and realize the
emanations of genius.</p>

<p>I have already sufficiently enlarged upon the inferiority
of barrels made from charcoal iron. A great
quantity of these guns are made or got up for the
general factors, who take orders for everything, from
&#8220;a needle to an anchor;&#8221; but they manufacture
nothing, and only employ their money <em class="ital">for a moderate
return</em>. The hardwareman is the principal seller of
this description of guns; he generally pays between
eight and ten pounds each for them, and retails them
at from twelve to fourteen pounds, if he can make his
customers believe that they are as good as they can
get elsewhere for twenty pounds. I have known a
tradesman of this kind sell more guns in a season
than three gun-makers in the same town during the
same time. A certain portion of the warranty was correct,
&#8220;that they were as good as could be got elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
for eighteen pounds;&#8221; for the articles, as far as barrels
and locks are concerned, are identically the same.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the generality of gunmakers are
content to live like the snail, who cares not how
the world goes, so long as his house remains whole
above his head; rather than try to improve their productions,
or to meet the exigencies of the times, they
are content to allow the trade to be injured by the
influx of worthless articles, to their own loss and the
discredit of the business generally. The enormous
prices which gentlemen have been charged for provincial-made
guns of the most inferior quality, has
driven them to obtain still worse at a less cost. An
honourable and tradesmanlike method of conducting
business will always be appreciated, and if a gun be
required at a low figure, an honestly-made article
might be furnished at a price to suit the customer,
and of equal and mutual benefit to buyer and seller.
But this will not do: high prices or no orders is the
rule. It would do very well if nothing were manufactured
but high-priced articles, as good in quality
as they pretend to be; but few provincial makers
have the means to do this: an establishment sufficiently
large can only be supported in certain districts.
I must be excused for making these remarks, as I
have both the interest of the maker, combined with
that of the sporting world, in view, and have no
other end to serve. I do not include all, only a part
of the profession in these strictures, for there are
many honourable exceptions.</p>

<p>The ironmonger receives these inferior guns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
disposes of them as stub-twist barrels: he knows no
other, nor would he care if he did. A flashy outside
is very captivating to the novice; but one or two
years&#8217; use will soon show the quality of the article:
the wood then shrinks, the glue and wax wash out of
the fittings, and an apparently crazy and breaking-up
constitution displays itself most clearly: for work put
together at a certain price will have only a certain
duration. Were I free of the gun-making profession
entirely, and asked for my conscientious advice in the
purchasing of a gun, I should decidedly say, buy a
gun from no one who has not a character to lose;
who is not only answerable for the article he sells,
but also capable of judging of the quality, and appreciates
the value of good materials. The trade is
over-run with swarms of Jew salesmen and others,
who cannot, nor ever will be, able to duly understand
and appreciate the responsibility attached to the profession
of a gun-maker.</p>

<p>There have been individuals in Birmingham who
realised considerable sums by manufacturing guns of
this quality only for two or three sale shops of puffing
celebrity in London, and so extensive are their orders
still, that an engraver is kept in full employment by
them, the excellence of whose forged imitations of
names, &amp;c., is wonderful: so devoid of shame and debased
in intellect do men become from perseverance
in evil. Joe Manton&#8217;s guns have become like pictures
of celebrated masters; had he produced one per hour
during his existence, he could not have made one-half
of the number that bear his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Guns made of threepenny skelp iron are plentifully
to be met with in sale-shops and pawnbroking
establishments; they generally bear false colours
and hail from fictitious ports, and are bedecked
with painted stocks and tawdry imitation gold
and silver ornaments; but as to the mechanical
arrangement, to use a Brummagism, they are as
if they had been pitched together. A decent
gun could be made with barrels of this quality,
if constructed a little heavier than usual; and it
would be perfectly safe, and suited for the use of
those who could not purchase better: if firm and
soundly fitted up, with decent locks, sound stock, &amp;c.,
it would be worth about eight guineas; but you can
get them by the hundred in Birmingham for 3<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr> 15<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr>
each, and, if you particularly wish it, at 2<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr> 15<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr>, or
less; and single guns, with plated barrels, about half
that sum.</p>

<p>We have now reached the utmost limits of civilization,
and are about to pass the great desert, where
science is never seen or heard of, except it be in
the pretences of an inventor of deceptions: things of
wood and iron, called guns. Pocket volcanoes would
be a fitter title, or portable exploders&mdash;for no one can
possibly expect anything but destruction who uses
such compounds of dangerous contrivances. But
for the edification of those who use such, we give the
prices of each part and cost of manufacture of them:
the statement is literally true; and, except that by
possibility the items may vary a penny or two, the
whole is substantially correct.</p>

<p>Common iron barrels plated with this iron can be

is similar in nature to brass; a metal with fibres
certainly, but they are like the fibres of willow
compared to oak: it is an iron soft and spongy,
capable of being condensed to an immense degree.
All slave gun-barrels are made of it. Mungo Park
detailed some of the lamentable atrocities committed
by these guns bursting. The many thousands of
mutilated wretches who have lived to curse the
cupidity of their fellow-men, form not a bright side
in the picture of human nature; but were you to
bawl into the ears of those employed in the construction,
all these and a thousand more such direful
effects of their handiwork, you would not abate one
in the number of these man-traps.</p>

article costs little manufacturing, it costs these men
still less. The slaughter-master is a cormorant, who
swallows the substance of the weak, and once past
his awful jaws he cannot be made to disgorge. Here
itinerant hardwaremen find an abundant supply: he
has always a stock. The wants of the poor are

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="chapname">THE PROOF OF GUN BARRELS.</span></h2>

<p>For a considerable period subsequently to the introduction
of the manufacture of gunnery into England,
there existed no public proof, or test, for the goodness
and safety of barrels; further than that the feeling
of the maker induced him to protect the limbs of
his customer. Even so early as the seventeenth
century, the bias of human nature to evil began to
be displayed in the production of materials for guns,
the use of which was attended with loss of both life
and limb. In consequence of the frequent bursting
of inferior guns, the Company of Gunmakers of the
City of London instituted a proof-house, to which
the barrels of respectable makers were all sent to
be proved. The East India Company required all
their muskets to undergo the same test; hence it
became a custom to have barrels proved there: many
also underwent an extra test on the premises of the
manufacturer; so jealous were sportsmen, and so necessary
was it deemed to provide against any possibility
of accident. Thus it was shown clearly that laws
are not always required to carry out certain results,
but that it is sometimes preferable to allow matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of this kind to be arranged according to the knowledge
of the parties interested; for frequently when
an individual is aware that there is a law under
which, in case of need, he can shelter himself&mdash;as
many do at this day in case of guns bursting&mdash;he
becomes careless: he has always a ready answer,
&#8220;I can assure you the barrel was proved; and there
must have been some unfortunate cause for her
going: you could not have rammed the wadding
home, or you must have put in an extra charge,&#8221;
and such like excuses. It is never for a moment
supposed that there was any insufficiency in the
proof.</p>

<p>The great demand for rubbish of a villanous
description during the existence of the slave trade,
induced some philanthropic gentlemen in Birmingham
to found a Company, with suitable premises, for
the proof of all gun barrels; and an Act of Parliament
was obtained in the year 1813, incorporating the body.
The first Act proved insufficient, as the Birmingham
makers found easy means of evading it; so they
had to obtain a fresh Act in 1815, by which parties
receiving any barrel to rib, stock, &amp;c., without its
having previously been proved, became liable to a
penalty of twenty pounds, and not less than twenty
shillings: it also enacted that any person or persons
making and selling any gun, the barrels of which
had not been proved at either this or the London
proof-house, became liable to the same penalty; and
it further enacted, that any person or persons forging
the stamps or marks of either of the two proof-houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
should be liable to the same penalties, and
in default of payment, to a certain term of imprisonment,
&amp;c. It also ordered, that all barrels be
proved with the quantity of powder in proportion
to the various bores enumerated in the table.</p>

<p>The severe, but just, strictures cast upon the lax
nature of this Act of Parliament, and the equally
lax way in which its provisions were carried out
(individual benefit being held to be the most important
element in the interpretation), imperatively
called for an immediate improvement. The heavy
denunciations which I felt bound to visit on the
defective working of this &#8220;miscalled proof of gun
barrels&#8221; in my former works, at length opened the
eyes, not only of the sportsman and the trade, but
also of the Government; and (I believe in 1854) it
was intimated to the proof companies of London
and Birmingham that the time had arrived &#8220;<em class="ital">when
gun barrels should be proved in reality</em>;&#8221; and that
if the initiative was not taken by the trade, the
Government were prepared to introduce a public
Act of Parliament for that purpose. The natural
consequence followed, and in 1855 an Act was passed
entitled &#8220;The Gun Barrel Proof Act 1855,&#8221; by
which most extensive powers are delegated to the
two companies.</p>

<p>The clause of most vital importance enacts that
all gun barrels shall be proved twice; first in the
rough, which is called provisional proof; and secondly,
when the barrels are soldered together, breeched, and
percussioned. Thus, in a comparatively finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
state, when all the necessary reductions and other
operations have been effected, the barrels become
properly tested. Not only the metal of the barrels
and the soundness of the breeches, but the screwing
in of the nipples is proved&mdash;a most important
check on a very important branch of workmanship,
and which if imperfectly done renders the
gun dangerous.</p>

<p>The first regulation enacts that &#8220;barrels are not
to be made up unless proved, and marked as proved.&#8221;</p>

<p>2nd. Small arms are not to be sold or exported
unless proved, and marked as proved.</p>

<p>3rd. Barrels provisionally proved and reduced in
strength are to be deemed unproved.</p>

<p>4th. Barrels reduced so that the mark does not
represent the proof are to be deemed unproved.</p>

<p>5th. Barrels with marks defaced are to be deemed
unproved.</p>

<p>6th. Barrels with marks removed are to be deemed
unproved.</p>

<p>7th. Barrels are to be marked according to scale.</p>

<p>Here follows a list of offences:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The preceding list of offences against the proper
conducting of the gun manufacture have been found,
after nearly three years&#8217; experience, to fulfil the intentions
of the framers<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of the bill. Undoubtedly a
much more healthy tone has been given to the constitution
of the trade; and it is to be fervently hoped
that it will entirely eradicate the evil of producing
such a vast amount of worthless and dangerous guns.
The double-proof has been too much for many of the
&#8220;sham damns.&#8221; No doubt much remains to be done
even yet; but the trade is progressing towards convalescence,
after this severe purging. With these
remarks I shall introduce schedule B of the new
Act.</p>

<p>The gunpowder used for proof shall be of equal quality and
strength with that which is now used by the Honourable Board of
Ordnance.</p>

<p>The balls used for the proof of barrels of all classes shall be of
lead, and spherical, and of the size and weight prescribed by the
scale for proof.</p>

<p>Barrels for arms of the second class and of the fourth class, and
for breech-loading arms of the fifth class, shall be proved provisionally
and definitively, and barrels for all other arms shall be
proved once definitively.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Conditions precedent to Proof.</i></p>

<p>Barrels for arms of the first class shall not be qualified for proof
until they shall be in a fit and proper state for setting up.</p>

<p>Barrels for arms of the third class shall not be qualified for proof
until they shall be in a fit and proper state for setting up, with the
proper breeches in; and all barrels lumped for percussioning shall
be proved through the nipple hole, with the proper pins or plugs in.</p>

<p>Barrels for arms of the second and fourth classes:</p>

<p>For provisional proof:&mdash;If of plain metal, shall be bored and
ground, having plugs attached, with touch-holes drilled in the plugs,
of a diameter not exceeding one-sixteenth of an inch. If any
touch-hole shall be enlarged, from any cause whatever, to a dimension
exceeding in diameter one-tenth of an inch, the barrel shall be
disqualified for proof. Notches in the plugs instead of drilled
touch-holes shall disqualify for proof. If of twisted metal, they
shall be fine-bored, and struck up, with proving plugs attached, and
touch-holes drilled as in the case of plain metal barrels.</p>

<p>For definitive proof:&mdash;The barrels, whether of plain or twisted
metal, shall be in the finished state, ready for setting up, with the
breeches in the percussioned state, break-offs fitted and locks
jointed; the top and bottom ribs shall be rough struck up, pipes,
loops, and stoppers on. All rifle barrels must be rifled; the top
and bottom ribs of double barrels shall be struck up, pipes, loops,
and stoppers on, the proper breeches in, and the thread of the
screws shall be sufficiently sound and full for proof.</p>

<p>Barrels for revolving arms of the fifth class shall have the
cylinders with the revolving action attached and complete.</p>

<p>Barrels for breech-loading arms of the fifth class shall be subject
to provisional proof, according to the class to which they belong,
and to definitive proof when the breech-loading action is attached
and complete.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Marks of Proof.</i></p>

<p>The marks applicable to the definitive proof shall be the proof
and view marks now used by the two companies respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The marks applicable to the provisional proof for the Gunmakers
Company shall be the letters (G.P.) interlaced in a cypher surmounted
by a lion rampant, and for the Birmingham Company
shall be the letters (B.P.) interlaced in a cypher surmounted by a
Crown.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as a number of gun barrels are loaded
according to the foregoing scale, they are taken to
a house or detached building, standing apart from
other offices. (The <a href="#Fig25">woodcut</a> represents the interior
accurately.) The house is lined throughout with
thick sheet iron, and the windows, which resemble
Venetian blinds, are constructed of the same metal.
Iron frames are laid the whole length of the room;
on these the barrels of various qualities, when about
to be fired, are placed. In the front of these frames
lies a large mass of sand, to receive the balls.
Behind the frame, on which the twist barrels are
fixed, lies another bed of sand; in which, on the
recoil, the barrels are buried. Behind the frame,
on which the common barrels or muskets are tried,
a strong iron bar is placed, having a number of holes
large enough to receive the tang of the breech, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
not the barrel. The barrels being thus fixed, it is
impossible for them to fly back. A groove runs
along the whole length of each frame, in which the
train of powder is strewed to ignite the charges,
upon which the barrels are laid, with the touch-holes
downwards.</p>

<p>When everything is ready for the proof, the
windows are let close down, the door is shut and
secured, and an iron rod heated red hot is introduced
through a hole in the wall. On igniting the
train, a tremendous explosion takes place. The
windows are then drawn up, the door opened, and
the smoke dissipated. The twist barrels are found
buried in the sand, the common ones are thrown
forwards; some are found perfect, others burst to
pieces. It is rarely that best barrels are found
burst; more frequently they are bulged, or swelled
out, in places which are faulty, or of a softer temper.
Those that are found perfect, are then marked with
the provisional punch of different sizes (but having
the same impression), according to the quality of the
barrel. In London and Birmingham they have now
an additional punch, containing the number of the
bore by which the barrel has been tried. This mark
easily enables the observer to discover whether the
barrel has had any considerable quantity bored out
after proving. Those that are bulged are sent to the
maker, who beats down the swellings, and sends back
the barrels to be proved again. They generally
stand the second proof, though we have known a
barrel undergo four proofs before it was marked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
The common barrels are required to stand twenty-four
hours before they are examined; when, if not
burst, any holes or other material imperfections are
made quite apparent by the action of the saltpetre.
Such barrels are, of course, sent back unmarked.
Those that are found satisfactory are duly stamped
and taken home.</p>

<p>The importance of the gun trade to England may
be estimated from the number of barrels proved
during the last year, 1857, of which the following is
a correct statement:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="chapname">THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Science begins at the point where mind dominates matter,
where the attempt is made to subject the mass of experience to
the scrutiny of reason. Science is mind brought into connection
with nature.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cosmos.</span></p></div>

<p>A new era in the science of gunnery may be dated
from the commencement of the latter half of the
nineteenth century; and long before its close other
improvements may be effected which shall eclipse
even those of our day. A new elementary principle
has been infused into the science. Rifles are now
really weapons of the highest order; in truth we may
be said to have only recently become acquainted with
the principles on which they should be constructed.
Little of science had hitherto been applied to them;
as military arms they were neglected for centuries,
to be ushered into notice at last by the unassisted
efforts of private individuals; Government, to whom
arms were of the greatest importance, having systematically
neglected all improvement, by invariably
refusing pecuniary aid, the only grease at all calculated
to overcome the friction retarding the wheels
of progress. It is an old proverb, that &#8220;one extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
begets another,&#8221; and when changes are once started,
the difficulty is to stop them; the tendency is to rush
on from one alteration to another, before we are
really well acquainted with what we have so hastily
thrown aside. Improvement does not always follow
a change; the human race, and the English more
especially, have an inordinate desire for &#8220;the marvellous;&#8221;
and multitudes of &#8220;wonderful discoveries&#8221;
and inventions of the utmost value are heralded
daily by the ever eager press, often to be as hastily
forgotten, or discovered, even by their promulgators,
to be myths.</p>

<p>Improvement, to be at all beneficial, must bring
with it all the elements of improvement; and to
render it easy of attainment, none of its essential
points should be costly. In gunnery more especially,
it is essential to avoid all unnecessary friction, excess
of recoil, and waste of gunpowder; whilst, at the
same time, transport of the gun must not be cumbersome,
and durability in all its points is essential.</p>

<p>How few study the subject in all its bearings!
How rapidly conclusions are jumped at! Even in
getting range, if it is to be purchased at the cost of
other essential principles, it is not economy to sacrifice
several even moderately valuable principles for
the sake of range alone. The experience of the
present age has shown that all our important
discoveries have their limits: the locomotive cannot
be used with advantage beyond a certain limited
speed; steam vessels attempted to be propelled at
an unusual velocity have but a very brief endurance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and rapidly decay. All matter has power only to
effect a certain amount of work, and this is endured
best at a medium application; showing most clearly
that &#8220;the race is not always to the swift or the battle
to the strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Experience is required in the greatest of modern
inventions. Electricity, at a moderate immersion,
subjected to a moderate superincumbent weight,
is an effectual messenger, swift as thought; but when
overweighted by immersion to depths where the
superincumbent pressure amounts to thousands of
pounds upon the square inch, then the messenger
becomes paralysed, and refuses to obey man&#8217;s will;
showing very clearly that until that pressure be
artificially removed by insulating the conducting
wire in tubes equal to restrain or keep from it that
enormous load, the lasting success of an Atlantic telegraph
is very doubtful. Many similar instances might
be cited to show the necessity of considering well the
established laws of nature, and their bearing on the
object pursued. In no science is this of more importance
than in gunnery; and the hundreds of useless
inventions in gunnery are to be ascribed to the non-observance
of these rules. The two-grooved rifle,
the &#8220;steam gun,&#8221; &#8220;the sciva,&#8221; &#8220;Warner&#8217;s long-range
myth,&#8221; and many other inventions equally absurd,
engage the attention for a time, but soon vanish: in
fact, all experience shows that improvement can only
be effected in accordance with certain established
principles of nature and practical science.</p>

<p>Iron, in quantities sufficient for all reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
requirements, is a dutiful servant; but, when
required of colossal proportions, it refuses to obey:
giving us a hint from nature, that we should be
content with moderation.</p>

<p>All the principles appertaining to science are
based on certain established laws; the unsoundness
of one renders the superstructure unsound also; and
any deductions drawn from unsound principles are
comparatively worthless. Gunnery, as a science, must
be in uniformity with truth in all its parts, or no
science exists in its arrangements. This will be best
illustrated by dividing the subject into several heads:
1st, the explosive power and its velocity; 2nd, the
retarding agents, air and friction; 3rd, the construction
of the projectile tubes; and 4th, the form of
projectile best calculated to attain a perfect result.</p>

<p>1st. The explosive power. Gunpowder has been
stated by different authorities to liberate its gases
with very different degrees of rapidity. Hutton
has given to it a much greater rapidity than Robins
has evidently even surmised; though, no doubt, as
we have already shown, high velocity in gunpowder
depends on several circumstances&mdash;the degree of
purification of its ingredients, their intimate mechanical
mixture (that the elements may exert their
affinities with the utmost facility), and, lastly, the
degree of granulation observed: and in addition,
the suitability of the tubes or vessels for carrying
on correctly such important experiments. Robins
and Hutton unquestionably may be regarded as
the English, if not the European, authorities, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
any work on the science of gunnery would be very
incomplete without their valuable elucidations.</p>

<p>Previously to the researches of Robins, the theory
of atmospheric resistance was but imperfectly surmised,
and when he made his statements of the
immense resistance which the fluidity of the air
offered to projectiles in a high state of velocity, they
were treated as the idle chimeras of a speculative
brain; and yet he only was enabled to estimate the
real effect of the explosive nature and force of gunpowder
to a very limited extent: indeed, so limited,
that Hutton, only twenty years subsequently, speaking
of Robins&#8217; theory, says, &#8220;Mr. Robins and other
authors, it may be said, have only guessed at, rather
than determined. That ingenious philosopher, in a
simple experiment, truly showed that, by the firing of
a parcel of gunpowder, a quantity of elastic air was
disengaged; which, when confined in the space only
occupied by the powder before it was fired, was found
to be nearly 250 times stronger than the weight or
elasticity of the common air. He then heated the
same parcel of air to the degree of red hot iron,
and found it in that temperature to be about four
times as strong as before; whence he inferred, that
the first strength of the inflamed fluid must be
nearly 1,000 times the pressure of the atmosphere.
But this was merely guessing at the degree of heat
in the inflamed fluid, and, consequently, of its first
strength; both which in fact are found to be much
greater. It is true that this assumed degree of
strength accorded pretty well with that author&#8217;s experiments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
but this seeming agreement, it might
easily be shown, could only be owing to the inaccuracy
of his own further experiments; and, in fact,
with far better opportunities than fell to the lot of
Mr. Robins, we have shown that inflamed gunpowder
is about double the strength that he has assigned to
it, and that it expands itself with the velocity of
about 5,000 feet per second.&#8221; On the same subject
he further says:&mdash;&#8220;On this principle it was that
Mr. Robins made all his experiments and performed
all his calculations in gunnery. But it is manifest
that this method of guessing at the degree of heat
of the flame must be very uncertain and unsatisfactory,
being much below the truth; since all our
notions and experience of the heat of inflamed
powder convince us that it is higher than that of
red hot iron, and, indeed, it has clearly appeared
from our experiments, that its heat is at least double
that of red hot iron, and that it increases the
elasticity of the elastic fluid more than eight times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here is evidence, though not conclusive, of the
immense force of gunpowder, and also of the progress
of knowledge on the subject; yet it clearly
shows the evil of coming to hasty conclusions, however
well supported by apparent facts, as it has
had in this case a tendency to check inquiry and
retard the advancement of knowledge. For the extensive
experiments of Hutton were but limited in
discovery, because they were not carried to a sufficient
extent, and thus, they are quite unsuited to
the present day. He was satisfied because he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
gone further than any of his predecessors; and though
he established and clearly proved the soundness of
his own theory, yet he could not either view the
subject to its utmost bounds, nor yet go sufficiently
far, but that others, taking up the question where
he left it, may pursue the subject to a much more
remote limit. The subject, indeed, was limited to him.
He far excelled Robins, no doubt, as he has shown;
but that involves no detraction from the merit due
to Robins for his experiments and discoveries, no
more than any individual proving the subject to be
a more extensive one than Hutton did, would excel
Hutton; for the value of improvement is more
to be attributed to him who lays the foundation,
than to him who raises the building. So is it in
this case; Robins laid the foundation for an extensive
knowledge of the nature and power of the
explosive fluids, and Hutton built upon that foundation
a certain extent of superstructure, and there he
left it, without roofing the building: he considered
the question as settled. Common consent has, as yet,
received his conclusion as unshaken and uncontroverted;
and it is not my intention to make the attempt
to controvert it, but merely to show that his deductions
fall short of what the principles of gunpowder-making
admit&mdash;carried out in the more extensive way
it has been within the last few years&mdash;owing to the
limited nature of his experiments. This is rather an
extensive position for me to occupy, or endeavour to
hold: but I do not mean the size of the <em class="ital">tools</em> of
<em class="ital">experiment</em> so much as the diversity of them; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
exploding ten thousand tons of powder in the same
machine and in the same way, would but give the
same or similar results; it is the variety and the
singularity of experiments that expand and increase
the fund of knowledge, and enable the mind to conceive
and comprehend the immensity of the power
and velocity of this wonderful combination. We
have been principally indebted to the exertions of
the chemist for means of purifying and extracting
from the ingredients which form this astonishing
compound force, the impurities and foreign substances
which exist, to a certain extent, in all the
three, and thus tending to form a more perfect combustion
by increasing the affinities.</p>

<p>Hutton shows that gunpowder is but so much
condensed air; for he says &#8220;We may hence, also,
deduce the amazing degree of condensation of the
elastic air in the nitre and gunpowder, and the
astonishing force experienced by its explosion. It
has been found by Mr. Robins, and other philosophers,
that 3-10ths of the mass of the powder
consists of the pure condensed air, or that the
weight of the condensed air is equal to 3-10ths of
the whole composition. But the whole composition
of the powder consists of eight parts by weight,
of which six parts are nitre, one part sulphur, one
charcoal; of which the nitre or 3-4ths of the composition
furnishes the whole of the condensed air,
while the sulphur and charcoal only give the fire
that produces the explosion. But 3-10ths of the
whole mass of eight parts is equal to 4-10ths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
six parts of nitre, that is 4-10ths or 2-5ths of the
nitre consists of condensed air, or the weight of
the gross matter in the nitre as four to six, or
as two to three; and these two parts, it is
probable, are of equal density or specific gravity.
Yet the specific gravity of nitre is 1,900, that of
water being 1,000, and of air 1&middot;2, which is contained
in 1,900, as much as 1,583 times; that is,
the air in the nitre must be condensed the amazing
quantity of 1,583 times, if its specific gravity be
equal to the compound nitre itself.&#8221; Also, &#8220;The
air is condensed in the nitre about 1,600 times,
nearly double the density of water, which may well
be considered as probably the greatest degree of compression
that air is capable of. Hence it may be
perceived that a prodigious force must be exerted
by nature in generating nitre; and as this great force
actually exists in nature, it is very probable that the
air in the nitre is thus compressed into the most
dense state possible, and in this consists the similitude
among the different particles of nitre.&#8221;</p>

<p>This extract from Hutton enables us to divest the
question of any technicalities, and puts it in so plain a
garb that the simplest mind may comprehend it. Now,
the great improvement of chemistry has been to extract
from the nitre the gross material which is contained
in the proportions&mdash;2-5ths impurities, and 2-5ths condensed
air; thus, half the quantity being useless, the
extraction of these alloys gives a greater quantity of
condensed gases in the same quantity of matter; for
if we take away 2-5ths of the proportions of useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
matter, and supply its place with 2-5ths more condensed
air, we thus get 4-5th explosive matter in the
same bulk of material, and thus simply obtain an
immense increase of power without an increase in
bulk. We have here evidence of the progress that
has been made in the science of explosive force.</p>

<p>Considering the difference between gunpowder in
1783 and gunpowder in 1858, I cannot say, with
Hutton, that the force is doubled now to what it
was when he wrote; but I believe that this would not
be far from the truth; for it must be quite clear&mdash;if
he is correct (which I believe he is) in saying
the force of gunpowder consists in the quantity of
explosive matter let loose and expanded by heat&mdash;that
the greater the quantity of condensed matter
we may have in any given weight, the greater the
force, and the more rapid the explosion: purified
saltpetre thus forming nearly pure gaseous matter; as
the diamond is pure carbon. It seems singular, and
is rather presumptuous to say, that Hutton was not
much of a chemist; but had he been more so, he must
have perceived that in the extraction of the foreign
matter from the nitre, existed the means of obtaining
an increased quantity of explosive power, and a proportionate
increase of speed or velocity in that explosive
material.</p>

<p>To ascertain the velocity best suited to all projectiles,
constitutes the germ of the science; and that we
are approaching a new era in even that more intimate
portion of the science, is daily apparent. Science shows
clearly that if a given force, a quantity to be correctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
ascertained, can produce a certain result, the use
of more is waste, and unworthy of the seeker after
perfection; and thus we have to determine upon, or
define, what is the degree or size of gun for certain
effects: a mere calculation nearly allied to that
portion of engineering which would define what
power of engine would work a thousand cotton
spindles, or raise a million gallons of water; and all
this will eventually be done. Science requires that
there should be no excess, no waste, no unnecessary
recoil, and all that combined with the utmost range
of projectile; this will have to be defined accurately
before we can clearly or truly say we are masters of
the science of gunpowder. True it is that the granulation
of gunpowder gives a clear road to its attainment;
but it will be a wearisome journey to reach the
summit: yet it must and will be effected, and the nation
that first attempts and carries out the attainment,
will evince a real love for and mastery of science.</p>

<p>The following practical experiments illustrate the
degree of velocity and the effects of projectiles so
clearly, that they alone will convey some idea of
the high velocity of the evolutions of the gases in
gunpowder.</p>

<p>My experiments are, like Robins&#8217;, on a small
scale; nor would I, like Hutton, try a brass gun of
sixty calibres in length, carrying a one-pound ball;
for one is strictly more limited than the other, and
thus rendered the results laid down by him imperfect:
for, as he says, &#8220;If you fill the tube with powder you
get no greater velocity, as there is not a duration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in the confinement to enable the powder to explode.&#8221;
If he had assimilated the grain of his powder to the
gun, he would have obtained a different result; and
a knowledge of this fact, I apprehend, makes all
the difference. The greatest velocity he obtained
was with powder 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> times the weight of the ball in
a gun of sixty calibres in length, and the velocity
he then obtained was only 3,181 feet per second.
The inferences that probably induced him to recommend
others not to endeavour to obtain a greater
velocity than 2,000 feet per second, were, like these
experiments, drawn from imperfect data. With a
ball of an ounce weight in a barrel of sixty calibres,
and with 3-4ths the weight of ball in powder, or
12 drachms, a velocity can be given to the ball to
equal it in force to 46,875 pounds. The velocity of
this ball I leave to the calculations of the mathematical
world. But, however, I will give the results
of a round of experiments tried to ascertain this; and
if the data laid down be correct, that the velocity of
a ball must be multiplied by its weight to find the
force, the result will be the establishment of a system
of velocity never yet dreamt of. I cannot but imagine
that there exists some error; though where it is I
know not: every deduction I have drawn is consequent
upon the results hereafter described.</p>

<p>&#8220;The power required to force a punch 0&middot;50 inch
diameter through an iron plate 0&middot;08 inch thick is
6,025 pounds, through copper 3,938 pounds. A
simple rule for determining the force required for
punching may thus be deduced:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Taking one inch diameter and one inch in
thickness as the units of calculation it is shown
that 150,000 is the constant number for wrought-iron
plates, and 96,000 for copper plates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Multiply the constant number by the given
diameter in inches, the product is the pressure in
pounds which will be required to punch a hole of a
given diameter through a plate of a given thickness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now an idea struck me, that this would form a
very good test of the comparative force of gunpowder,
and I consequently commenced an extensive round
of experiments.</p>

<p>In the first attempt I found the results to vary
with the weight of the pendulum of iron plate, and
that it was necessary to obtain uniformity of size and
surface; as it must be comprehended that the only
resisting medium to the pendulous plate was atmospheric
resistance, and a dissimilarity of size of surface
would invariably give different results. Having
a number of plates of the different thicknesses hereafter
described, I continued increasing the charge
from a definite quantity, until the projectile was
driven with sufficient velocity to perforate the plate
suspended. The gun selected for this purpose was
of heavy material, weighing nearly seventeen pounds,
it was three feet long, the metal of the barrel as
thick at the muzzle as at the breech, and carried a
spherical ball of sixteen to the pound, or one ounce,
and which fitted tight with the thinnest patch procurable.
The bore was perfectly cylindrical, and plain
inside, being polished longitudinally to a high state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
fineness. With a charge of twelve drachms of Curtis
and Harvey&#8217;s diamond grain powder, the ball went
through the half-inch plate, but went only a few
yards further; denoting that the effort necessary had
nearly exhausted its velocity and momentum.</p>

<p>The recoil of the gun was of the most severe
description, and the shoulder had to be protected
for many explosions previous to this high charge.
The larger sized grain was insufficient, ten drachms
effecting the greatest extent of power it seemed
capable of, and it became quite apparent that the
tube would not explode more powder, as indications
convinced me: when any more was added, a portion
came out unburnt.</p>

<p>The force necessary to effect this, by the above
calculation, is 46,795 pounds.</p>

<p>The next plate was 7-16ths thick, and a charge of
ten drachms punched the piece out clean; nine and
a half drachms were equal to it, when the centre
of the pendulum could be hit fairly, because there
was then an equal resistance from the atmosphere,
which cannot exist in cases where the edge of the
disc receives the blow.</p>

<p>I got with ease a perforation in a 6-16ths plate,
with a charge of either fine or coarse powder, not
exceeding eight drachms; a charge of seven drachms
of fine grain was unequal to the task; but seven
drachms of the coarse showed evidently greater
effects produced, though the perforation was not
perfect. Six and a half drachms of No. 2 grain
penetrated a plate of 5-16ths thick easily, while it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
took full six and three-quarters drachms of fine grain;
five drachms of the larger perforated a quarter-inch
plate, but it took full five and a half drachms of
fine grain to effect the same; while a 3-16ths plate
took three and three-quarters drachms of fine, or three
and a quarter of No. 2 grain; and 1-8th plate was
easily punched by a charge of two and a half drachms
coarse or three drachms fine. I will place the relative
results in a table, with the force effected by each:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Were I to adopt the established method of calculation,
multiplying the weight of ball by the velocity,
I should get an answer that would point to the utter
impossibility of any such velocity being possible.
And yet the result is, according to the rule of
figures, correct; but in truth there are exceptions
to many rules, for they are only correct when applied
to known products.</p>

<p>That the velocity of these balls was much, very
much, greater than 7,000 feet per second of time,
there cannot be any doubt; it was nearly three times
that. Yet I must not conceal the fact, that this
punching is the more perfect, the higher the velocity;
and it shows how the fibres of iron are separated
from a want of vibration to equilibrise the cohesion.
Mr. Colthurst found that duration of pressure lessened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the ultimate force necessary to punch through
metal, and thus it may be that extremely quick pressure
may produce the same. Therefore I suspect it is
not the most correct theory that calculates force to be
accomplished at all times by extreme velocity; there
will be found discrepancies in the rule, and one of
them arises from no calculation ever having been
made with extreme velocities: medium velocities may
generally give such conclusions, but the very extreme
in this case can never have been taken into consideration
at all; as I have very little doubt&mdash;in fact, I
am certain&mdash;that no person ever obtained such high
velocity before. It must, and is a vast deal greater,
incomprehensibly greater, than any velocity obtained
by Hutton; and much more extensive than ever could
be obtained, or, in fact, ever will, by any ordnance
whatever. I wish much I could have experimented
with a gun of greater length and bore, for with one
in every way fitted for the purpose, I have no doubt
of being able to perforate an inch thickness of plate.</p>

<p>Should any person possessing the opportunity and
means, wish to try the experiment, I would advise them
to get a barrel of 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet long, 8 bore, to carry a 2 oz.
ball, and of a weight to allow of extending the explosion
up to 30 drs. of powder; they would then obtain the
extent of force I have suggested. There is a certain
point to be strictly observed: see that the plate you
use is perfectly sound; for if laminated, or composed
of various plates not firmly welded and attached, the
experiment would be imperfect, as there would be an
uneven vibration created, and acting as the hammer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
does when held against the point of the nail while
driving it in, clinches the point, so does the substance
in the portions of plate prevent a perforation. An
ounce ball, suspended against the back of the pendulum,
by the jar or blow it receives and communicates,
completely prevents the effect, and the ball is flattened,
instead of perforating the object struck: so is it if
you place a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch plate against any support; it thus
has the power of perfectly resisting the force of the
ball, though fired with considerably more power than
is requisite under other circumstances. The effect
appears to be chiefly mechanical; the outer fibres are
driven in upon those behind them with such quickness
that they lose cohesion, or are condensed quicker
than the waves of vibration travel, thus giving them
no means of communicating the vibration. But when
punched, the rapidity of their motion produces in the
metal a sound of the most intense vivacity, which
plays upon the ear for a considerable period, with
rather a pleasant effect. Lead alone is capable of
being used in this experiment; except, of course, the
precious metals, which it would not be <em class="ital">convenient</em> to
use. Even an adulteration of the slightest quantity
of solder is sufficient to prevent the result which lead,
pure, will invariably give. Lead projected against
lead, if sufficiently thick, cannot perforate, but the
lesser portion becomes flattened; a cast-iron ball fired
against lead, with a certain velocity, is broken into
pieces, affecting the lead comparatively little: showing
beautifully the peculiarity of dense incompressible
bodies to resist most effectually the greater the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
velocity with which they are struck. Water will, if
struck very sharply with the flat of a sword, act
against the blow in a way to splinter the blade into
pieces. The greater the velocity with which a ball is
fired into water, the less the depth of penetration;
thus showing clearly the many excellent properties
of dense incompressible bodies as projectiles, and
proving the objection that lead is too soft for artillery
to be without a foundation, and only entertained from
a want of knowledge of its nature.</p>

<p>A point of great importance was exemplified during
these experiments; and as the question has lately
given rise to considerable discussion, it will be well
that the facts should be stated.</p>

<p>At very short distances from the muzzle of the gun
the penetration was found to be less than at distances
more extended. At five yards the iron plate could
not be perforated; at ten yards the effect was much
greater, but fifteen yards was the least distance at
which it could be said to be effectually perforated; at
twenty yards the result was still more satisfactory,
clearly demonstrating that bullets gain both in velocity
and penetration for a considerable distance after
leaving the muzzle of the gun. The following experiments
verify this remark:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the report of the experiments which were carried
on at Cork in 1852, it is stated that the power
of penetration of an elongated rifle bullet gradually
increases as the range is increased, up to 190 yards.</p>

<p>In order to prove this, experiments were carried on
at Enfield for three days with a variety of fire-arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and different sorts of projectiles. On the fourth day
the experiments were repeated with the common
musket and Wilkinson&#8217;s rifle. The former, at forty
yards, gave a penetration of 2&middot;25 inches; and the
latter averaged 2&middot;75, in a target of green elm. Again:
at ninety yards, the musket penetrated 2&middot;25 inches,
and the rifle 3&middot;5 inches. At 120 yards, the musket
gave 2&middot;5 inches, and the rifle 3&middot;25. Both being subsequently
fired at every successive ten yards up to
220, the result was that the penetration of the
musket ball gradually decreased in power as the
distance increased, while the elongated bullet gained
power of penetration up to 190 yards; after which it
slightly decreased.</p>

<p>2nd. Consequent on the velocity of the explosive
fluids is the resistance of that a&euml;riform fluid filling all
space. It has been calculated that in a vacuum, matter
in motion would be a long time in coming to rest;
and very providentially it is that nature in her grand
arrangements has made one element to control another.
In no other portion of nature&#8217;s work has
anything more wonderful than atmospheric air been
produced; its action on the velocity of projectiles is
of so extensive a nature, that without clearly understanding
that action, the science of gunnery never can
be thoroughly acquired. The resistance of the atmosphere
is in proportion to the velocity of the attempt
to displace it; the higher that velocity becomes, the
greater is the resistance. This is shown by the actions
of all the fulminates. A quantity of the fulminate of
silver exploded on a copper plate will perforate that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
plate, or, if fired upon a piece of wood, will bury
itself in that substance, splintering it in proportion to
the quantity. Now, ordinary gunpowder has no such
effect as this, because, though it may produce the
same amount of expansive gas, it produces it at one-fourth
the velocity of the fulminates: the air is
driven back upon itself so gradually as to offer no
very important resistance; but the action of the fulminates
is so rapid and so violent that the high
elasticity of the air has not time to yield, and the
force is driven into the apparently more solid material,
the copper or the wood.</p>

<p>The mode in which atmospheric resistance mostly
interferes with projectile force is owing to the
columnar form it assumes in the tubes of all descriptions
of gunnery. If the velocity of gunpowder be
as great as we suppose it to be, the displacement
of a column of air must be effected by driving
the whole column in a gun-barrel of many inches,
into a column probably less than half an inch in
height; or, if the length of the tube from the starting
of the charge to the muzzle be 38 inches, then
will the displacement require a force capable of condensing
thirty-eight atmospheres into one, or something
like 570 lbs.; without estimating the lateral
pressure of that column on the sides of the gun-barrel,
which may be safely estimated at one-half more. It
may be supposed that the column would be partially
in motion for a greater distance than half an inch in
front of the projectile; but this is disproved by the
fact that time is essential to put a&euml;riform matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
in motion, and naturally it never does so at a greater
velocity than it is familiarly known to do in the shape
of winds: but the fact is better illustrated by the
frequent bursting of barrels near the muzzle, caused by
a piece of snow or clay, a piece of paper or wadding.
Were a current established around this projection it
would pass on, but the air strikes these light obstructions
when in a high state of condensation, amounting
to many atmospheres in one: so many as to be nearly
equal to a solid which is more powerful than the
barrel; the latter therefore succumbs to it.</p>

<p>The resistance of the air is so highly philosophical
a question, that I merely touch on its actual
bearings on the passage of projectiles to show how
the quantity of force is absorbed or expended in
relation to the quantity of the gunpowder employed;
which, it may be assumed, is a proportion of nearly
one-third of the whole, or a quantity independent of
that necessary to give velocity to the leaden projectile,
to enable it to overcome the still and uniform
impeding agent up to the end of its flight. The
rapid exit of the bullet from the barrel, with a
resisting influence of this weight into the comparatively
insignificant one of 15 lbs. to the square
inch, will fully explain how it is that a bullet increases
in velocity even up to a considerable distance
after leaving the muzzle of the gun; and further
showing that in all arrangements of truly scientific
gunnery, the increasing resistance must be met by
a fresh production of explosive fluid over every atom
of space in that tube, where it is demonstrable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the resistance is increasing in a geometrical progression
as the point of exit is becoming nearer; so
that gunnery, unless all the contingencies are provided
for, must necessarily remain an imperfect science.</p>

<p>Intimately allied to the displacement of the atmosphere
is the amount of friction. Gunnery is now
rid of the anomaly of being assisted by friction: the
detention of the projectile in the tube by artificial
friction, to enable more force to be generated, is one
of those absurdities pardonable only in bygone days.
Science is best consulted by lessening friction; guns
of steel, with interiors as fine as the polish in a
mirror, are found to shoot best: a rough road is but
so much force uselessly absorbed; the experience of
the last few years having proved that a range of
1,800 yards cannot be accomplished except with
barrels having surfaces as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>Rifles, no doubt, are now in use in which, by
increasing the degree of spiral, friction is more than
doubled, perhaps trebled; but such unscientific constructions
are but as one error to counteract another.
Unscientifically formed projectiles not having in themselves
the principles necessary for true flight, have to
receive a counteracting agency in the shape of additional
spinning, on an axis coincident to the line
of flight, to enable them to range a given distance,
with, as it will be perceived, an additional amount
of expellant agency; but these cannot be included
in the category of scientific gunnery.</p>

<p>3rd. Next to absence of friction is the construction
of the gun barrel. Already have we shown that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
inner surface of a gun barrel requires to be like
glass; next to this it is necessary that the metal
should be composed of the most unyielding structure.
Metals absorb force in proportion to their softness:
a barrel constructed of lead gives the worst result
of any metal; in truth, as is the increase of tenacity
and density in the tube, so is the increase of range
in projectiles. The wonderful results displayed by
the use of steel guns of all descriptions bear out
this assertion to the fullest extent. A yielding gun
barrel may be compared to the dragging of a heavily
loaded waggon over boggy ground, which rises in a
wave before the wheels during its progress.</p>

<p>4th. Next in importance to the inflexibility of the
gun barrel is the form of projectile best calculated to
displace the atmosphere during its extended flight.
Under the head of <a href="#Page_338">Rifles</a> this subject will be more
fully discussed; but, as thousands of years have stamped
the arrow as being in accordance with nature&#8217;s laws,
it should no doubt be the object of science to approximate
the leaden projectile to that form as much
as possible, and hence the cylindro-conoidal may be
assumed to be the best form of projectile.</p>

<p>That both Jacob&#8217;s and Whitworth&#8217;s bullets partake
of a certain amount of &#8220;<em class="ital">wabbling</em>&#8221; motion after
leading the muzzle of the gun is certain, from their
length, as well as from the fact that in both the centre
of gravity is in the hinder part of the bullet; thus they
are both in reality bad in a scientific point of view.</p>

<p>If any merit can be claimed for either, it is on
account of the mechanical ingenuity displayed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
neutralizing the effects of want of scientific principle.
The want of principle, however, is not the only evil,
were such guns to come into general use; their
manufacture, in the hands of that portion of the gun
trade which never estimates consequences, and never
studies the theory of the science at all, but manufactures
all fire-arms by &#8220;rule of thumb,&#8221; would prove
dangerous in the extreme.</p>

<p>The bursting of barrels in any attempt to project
lengthened projectiles is of a very different description
to that which ordinarily occurs, on account of
the different direction in which the force is applied.
In consequence of their greater length, and their
increased friction against the sides of the barrel, they
are more reluctantly set in motion&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, their inertia
is with greater difficulty overcome. The result of
this is, that in overcoming their inertia the greatest
strain is exerted backward, on the breech of the gun;
which, if not more firm than usual, is blown out,
entering the forehead of the shooter: an accident
which would prove fatal not only to the gun, but to
the person who used it.</p>

<p>This accident may no doubt be effectually guarded
against by strengthening the breech end of the gun
as well as the breech itself; but without that precaution
it is to be feared that such accidents would
be of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>A considerable error may easily be promulgated,
as to the heat necessary to be applied ere gunpowder
will explode. A late writer says, it is necessary to
raise it to 600 degrees before it is explosive. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
is a splitting of hairs, and such a palpable mystification,
that it is scarcely worth noticing. But I will
explain: if you place upon a plate a few grains
of powder, by heating the plate underneath (for
instance, on a smith&#8217;s fire,) you will see the sulphur
giving out a blue flame, it being easily fused. As the
plate becomes heated to nearly a red heat, the whole
explodes, in consequence of the charcoal and nitre not
being hot enough to allow the gases generating the
heat to be liberated; but as soon as this does take
place the explosion ensues. Now, it is a well known
fact, that the smallest particle of matter possessing
above 600&deg; of heat, will ignite any quantity of powder
it comes in immediate contact with; we will suppose
with one portion of charcoal, one of sulphur, and one
of nitre (it matters not how small they are: a ten
hundredth part of the substance of one of the smallest
grains of powder would suffice), and if it has the means
of communicating to these small portions 600&deg;, this
is sufficient, as their explosion induces also that of
the very largest quantity: for it ought to be perfectly
understood, that a great explosion is but so many
millions of small ones combined, and by their united
force effecting the great results we see. The ingredients
of powder are ground and intimately mixed
together on the bed of the mill to the great extent
they are, to the end that, if possible, there shall not
be in the composition two grains or portions of one
ingredient in immediate contact with each other;
but that, when the ignition does take place, each may
be present to add its peculiar gas, in order that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
affinity may be supplied. Thus becomes evident the
necessity of a most extensive incorporation, a blending
and equal division of mixture throughout the whole
material.</p>

<p>The advantage of unglazed gunpowder is here
fully shown; for it presents an inequality, a roughness
of surface, over which the flame from the percussion
mixture cannot travel without igniting some
of the prominent parts, and thus the whole. You
may glaze powder and make it so smooth that it
would be very difficult indeed to ignite; but except
that it enables the powder to resist moisture better,
it is otherwise very detrimental, as tending both to
prevent ignition and lengthening the period of effecting
it.</p>

<p>The flame from the percussion powder is of that
intense and vivid description, that if a charge of
powder in the breech of a gun is loose, the flame
will form a mass of condensed air round itself, and
driving the grains of powder before it, prevent the
immediate contact of the heat and the particles of
powder, until the heat is expended; and thus arises
a &#8220;miss fire.&#8221; If the powder is up only to the
nipple, there being a quantity of air in the tube
of that nipple, the explosion of the fluid will drive
down this air, and condense it between the powder
and top of the nipple to such an extent as to cause
a certain &#8220;miss fire.&#8221; It becomes requisite to find
a remedy for this, and it can only be done by bringing
the powder into the very vicinity of the explosion
on the nipple. This can be effected in several ways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
but the most perfect is to obtain as direct a communication
as possible; a widening of the perforations
of the breech, and space to allow the powder
free access up the nipple. For this purpose we propose
an improved form of nipple. The centre one of
the three (here shown in section) is considerably
broader and shorter than the others. A cap made
broader and not so deep would be an improvement, as
bringing the point of ignition nearer the charge, and
thus effecting a saving of time; for great and wonderfully
quick as is the explosion, it is clear to the senses
that it may be quickened. We are not finding fault
with the &#8220;lightning being too slow,&#8221; as Colonel
Hawker says; but science means perfection, and the
nearer we can come to it the better.</p>

<p>The nipples now in general use have the smaller
orifice at the bottom, and, being lined with platina,
never foul. Experience has shown that admitting the
gunpowder into the nipple &#8220;is not advantageous,&#8221;
especially with large grained powder; by constructing
the nipple with the small orifice at the bottom,
the largest grain can be used beneficially. As the
velocity of the fulminating gas is much greater than
&#8220;a train&#8221; of gunpowder ever can be, quickness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
also gained by their adoption. I have used them for
many years with great success; nothing but cost
deters their general adoption. The passing of the
flame through the very small opening in the platina,
by this very high impingement, increases its heat to a
great extent, ensuring explosion.</p>

<p>The true science of gunnery consists in knowing
that a certain force is requisite to effect a certain
purpose, or, in other words, to kill at a certain distance;
and also how to arrange that force so as to
effect the purpose without having any extra <em class="ital">force</em>, or
any waste of powder, nor yet too little, but with a corresponding
result: a sufficiency; neither more nor less.
This we have shown is attainable by the mechanical
arrangement of granulation; for it is useless to use
less, or to use an iota more of fine grain powder, if
the size larger will effect the purpose without that
iota. Propellant velocity is the grand desideratum in
all gunnery; the obtainment of this, to the greatest
extent, is the power of killing at the greatest distance:
all ranges are dependent on velocity; no
extreme <em class="ital">range</em> can be obtained without a corresponding
speed.</p>

<p>The very finest powder, it will be perceived, is
fitted&mdash;perfectly fitted, preferable, indeed&mdash;to coarser
grain for guns of a short length of tube, where a
perfect combustion of the whole charge can be
obtained without any waste or want; but as such is
quite unsuited for longer barrels: I cannot too
often repeat it. The column of air is the ruling
power. Look what its effects are by Hutton&#8217;s calculations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
with the very low velocities he obtained!
So great as to bring all projectiles he used to a
medium velocity, before they were projected beyond
a certain distance. Then what must its resistance be
where the velocities are trebled? I say trebled, for
my powder and the percussion combined have more
than trebled the velocities. You must then clearly
have a powder of such grain as suits the capacity of
your gun. All barrels have a size of grain that
will suit them best, and manufacturers of gunpowder
will consult their own profit and the convenience
of sportsmen, if they assimilate the grain of powder
to various sizes; as in shot, to No. 1, No. 2, 3, 4, 5,
and so on: eventually this system must be adopted.</p>

<p>This will explain quite clearly how the fact (singular
to many) occurs, of short guns excelling their longer
competitors, and how frequently a particular maker
obtains an immensity of credit for an excellent gun
only twenty-two inches: &#8220;Beat my Lord So-and-so&#8217;s
of thirty inches!&#8221; and how, &#8220;When I cut four inches
off my double, she shot better than ever she did.&#8221;
All these occurrences are perfectly dependent on a
knowledge of the generating of the explosive force,
and may be reversed at any time by a person possessed
of sufficient knowledge of these facts: put
in coarse grain into the short gun, and fine into the
long, and the facts will be changed considerably, as
will be easily seen. A degree of mystery has hitherto
existed as to the cause of this discrepancy; but I
trust this explanation will clear it up.</p>

<p>Experiment has shown the error of stating that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
only a certain quantity of powder could be consumed:
the proportion stated was considerably below
the actual quantity, as the experiments of punching
the plates show; for since twelve drachms can be
burnt in a three-feet barrel, therefore ten drachms
may be consumed in one two feet eight inches,
with a given weight to lift. In addition to this,
must be placed the fact of improvement, both in the
composition and granulation of the powder; which we
have no hesitation in stating has been considerable,
within only a very few years, all tending to the quickness
of generating force. The granulatory system,
if acted upon, will give the sportsman or soldier a
completely new power in gunnery; for it must be
evident, if we have the means of projecting certain
bodies with an extreme velocity, say 5,000 feet per
second, it becomes a simple calculation to ascertain the
quantity of force and length of tube to give to a certain
weight. Take, for instance, an ounce ball in a
barrel two feet six inches long. Extremely fine grain
powder, from its rapidity of expansion, gives to the
ball this velocity at fifteen inches from the breech;
the remaining fifteen inches contain a column of air
highly condensed, which will inevitably reduce this
velocity back nearly fifty per cent., or 2,500, and
with that velocity the ball leaves the muzzle. Therefore,
as we have already said, it must be evident you
have here generated a high speed to be as quickly
reduced; and it shows clearly that if a different grain
of powder would expand from breech to muzzle,
increasing the velocity on a granulated scale until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
obtained the highest, or 5,000 feet per second, as the
ball left the muzzle, you would save here clear 50 per
cent. in force, with less recoil, less internal strain on
the barrel, and with exactly the same weight of
powder; thus showing that you have just a definite
quantity of force in a definite quantity of powder.</p>

<p>The true science of gunnery is the knowledge how
to best arrange the collateral parts, so that you may
obtain the greatest result with the least means. I
have also clearly shown that the resistance of the
atmosphere is one, and the principal obstruction in
the attainment of high velocities; its resistance being
regulated entirely by the degree of speed with which
it is wanted to be displaced. Thus it is true, as
both Robins and Hutton have shown, that only a
certain velocity can be obtained beneficially; though
the degree is considerably greater then either conceived,
as far greater impetus has been obtained,
and projected bodies have ranged much beyond their
calculations, and that beneficially too. One drawback
on the theory of these gentlemen is their calculating
the velocities with iron projectiles; for the
heavier the material the more powerful the momentum,
and consequently the longer retention of their
velocity, from not presenting the same space to the
resisting medium, the air.</p>

<p>The development of the system of granulation must
and does exercise considerable control over the shooting
of barrels of every description. I have already
explained what has been hitherto considered the
curious phenomena of short and long barrels shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
so dissimilarly, and this illustration completely establishes
the fact of the expulsive and repulsive forces
being controlled by each other: as either preponderates,
so is the result. The open-ended barrel
projecting balls, and eventually bursting, is a beautiful
and interesting elucidation, both of the force of
gunpowder and the stubborn nature of the atmospheric
fluid. All these facts are valuable, inasmuch
as they lay bare circumstances which have never
been satisfactorily accounted for, and enable the mind
of lowest capacity to understand the cause and effect.</p>

<p>The superiority of one barrel in throwing shot
stronger and more evenly distributed, arises, it will be
easily seen, from the absence, or existence of, internal
friction, when contrasted with the different degrees of
expelling force, and the degree of resistance from the
atmosphere; it also accounts clearly for the fact of
guns shooting stronger on one day than on another, in
fine and in rough weather: the weight, the resistance
of the air, is the only cause of the variation; for
gunpowder cannot drive back a dense atmosphere as
quickly as a lighter one. The cause of guns bursting
is to be placed to the account of both air and the
generation of the explosive fluid so instantaneously;
the solid front which air offers to quick compression,
throws the force on the barrel, and the sides of the
tube give way because they are weaker: this cannot
occur so easily with powder of a more gradually
expansive force, therefore safety is consulted in its
use, in addition to the numerous advantages it otherwise
possesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Blaine, in his Encyclop&aelig;dia of Rural Sports,
has the following: &#8220;The increase of metal in the
detonator, we think, with Colonel Hawker, to be
an essential requisite, first, to resist the quicker,
and, consequently, more forcible, expansive force
applied by the ignition of the powder through the
agency of detonation, and tend to lessen the recoil
so much more forcibly felt in most detonators. This
increased weight of percussion Mr. Greener, however,
objects to, and inquires, &#8216;Whether some of
the best flint guns met with, have not been very
light?&#8217; To this we answer, that it was the principle
on which the explosion of the flint gun was effected
that enabled it to be made lighter, and yet to remain
equally safe in using; but we also know, that where
it was required to add to the rapidity and force of
the ignition, it then became necessary to increase the
substance of the barrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Experience teaches the writer, and I dare say it
would Mr. Blaine, if he were to experiment to the
extent I have done, that there is no rapidity in the
ignition further than the closing of that point of
ignition by the cock, and no &#8220;force&#8221; beyond what
the comparative instantaneous ignition of the gunpowder
in the nipple creates. This is quite sufficient
to prevent the further penetration of the percussion
flame; and the only increase, to quote his own words,
&#8220;to resist the quicker, and, consequently, more expansive,
force applied by the ignition of the powder
through the agency of detonation,&#8221; arises from an
improvement (as it is termed) in the granulation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the powder, which alone creates the increased expansive
force. This will be clearly understood by any
one reading this work from the beginning; the only
difference between the flint and percussion systems
is the stopping of the orifice of ignition in one, and
allowing it to escape in the other; for the flame has
to travel to <em class="ital">windward</em> (to use a nautical expression)
in the flint; the other has its own accumulating
power to force ignition through the body of the
powder. This alone constitutes the difference. The
necessity for an increase of metal at the breech of
a barrel does not arise from any peculiarity in the
mode of communicating the fire, but in the increased
inflammability of the powder alone. The extreme
smallness of grain has effected this more than the
use of fulminating flame; and the continuous cry for
fine powder, to get better up the nipples, has produced
an alteration which is placed wrongfully to
the credit of the percussion.</p>

<p>Again, he says, &#8220;Mr. Greener, however, would
have us acquire this increase of power of resistance,
not by quantity of material, but by increased tenacity
and elasticity in the metal the gun is formed of, and
we agree that it would be a great improvement if it
could be brought about. But what is our prospect
of it? Is it not the general complaint that gun
metal is not by any means what it was? We have
shown that it is not; and, therefore, we do not
think, as Mr. Greener asserts, that any recommendation
of increased weight of metal to the percussion
barrel beyond that of the flint gun &#8220;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
founded on ignorance;&#8221; but, on the contrary, that
the very reason Mr. Greener gives to prove it, is
that which we think affords evidence of its perfect
rationality, <em class="ital">the explosive force created</em>.&#8221; The answer
given above applies to this also: save on the score
of lessening recoil, superior quality is preferable, to
quantity.</p>

<p>The shooting powers of gun barrels are dependent
on two circumstances&mdash;goodness of metal, and a
proper shape of exterior: it cannot be too often
repeated, <em class="ital">that a gun barrel is a spring</em>, to all intents
and purposes; if you add metal, you add stubbornness,
and destroy that expansibility, without the
existence of which the barrel is, comparatively speaking,
useless. Heavy, ponderous barrels do not propel
a charge of shot with either that smartness or
degree of closeness that a barrel more scientifically
constructed does; you have less recoil certainly, but
the addition of half an inch of more metal behind
the butt of the breech would do this more effectually,
and save you carrying an additional weight. The
gradual ignition of powder obviates the necessity
of a great thickness of metal in the sides of the
barrels; but if it is determined to persevere in the
use of peculiarly fine grained powder, you would
certainly be justified, nay, required, to have more
and better metal than at present, for the electrical
nature of the explosion will throw upon the tube
that force which would be more judiciously employed
in giving impetus to the charge of projectiles.</p>

<p>I have found that expansion will increase the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
shooting powers of a barrel; but then it must not
be the expansion of an unelastic piece of metal, but
of metal whose elasticity rebounds with a force equal
to that with which it expands; for whatever else you
may obtain by creating friction, by boring the breech
end of the barrel wider you obtain a greater expansion,
as it no doubt has that tendency. We find it
an invariable fact, that when barrels are very heavy,
compared with their size of bore (if a cylinder), they
shoot weak. Also, when barrels are made of irons
of different temperatures, where one is placed to
prevent the expansion or springing nature of the
other, they are never found to shoot well. As a
proof of this fact, let any one take the best barrel
he ever shot with, and encase it with lead very
tight; fire it at a dozen sheets of paper, and see
if the effect be equal to what it was when the barrel
was unencumbered. On the contrary, it will be
found to have shot very weak, though close. Let
him then examine the lead; and, if any moderate
substance, he will find that the explosion has enlarged
it considerably. This experiment I have tried repeatedly,
and can vouch for its truth.</p>

<p>The proof of barrels is another fact corroborating
the truth of our assertion. What else can occasion
the bulging, but the expansion? Where the barrels
are possessed of soft and hard portions (which is the
result of different tempers of different metals), one
expands further than the other, and then, of course,
the soft part receives no assistance from the hard,
and it does not return to its original state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Put on a barrel, from the breech end to the
muzzle, a number of rings of lead; be sure you
have them tight, and not further apart than three or
four inches; fire that barrel with a usual charge,
and if it be a correct taper for shooting, it will
have expanded the whole of the rings an equal distance.</p>

<p>From the observations already made, the reader
will perceive that the shooting of all barrels depends
on a certain degree of friction. The degree of friction
necessary, varies according to the nature and
substance of the metal. Those metals that require
least shoot best. The object of the friction is to
create a greater force, by detaining the charge longer
in the barrel. If, then, there should not be an extra
quantity of powder to consume, the friction would be
a decided evil.</p>

<p>This may be understood by rifle practice, in which
we find that a short barrel of eighteen inches, with a
certain charge, will throw a ball as straight, and quite
as strong, or stronger, than a barrel of three feet,
loaded with a similar charge. I account for this fact
thus: the barrel of eighteen inches will burn all the
powder put into it; the long one can do no more. As
soon as the ball has left the short barrel, it meets
with no impediment but the air. By the time the
ball in the longer one has travelled eighteen inches
the powder is all consumed; the volume of air in the
remaining eighteen inches acts as a destroyer of the
force given to it, and it naturally drops its ball short
of the other. Increase the charge of powder to as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
much as the long one can burn, and then it will throw
its shot to nearly twice the distance of the other.</p>

<p>An addition of powder beyond the quantity the
barrel can consume is disadvantageous; the reverse
will be found equally so. Thus it is with fowling-pieces.
The quantity of powder that a gun would
burn in the shape of a cylinder, would be too little,
when, by altering that shape, you increase the friction.
The quantity must, therefore, be increased, or this
friction will diminish the force of the shot. It is on
this that the mistaken supposition is founded, that
short barrels will shoot as far as long ones. It is
true that with a small charge, or very fine powder,
the short barrel will kill at the distance of thirty
yards, as well as the long one; but put in the long
one as much powder as it can consume, then try the
two at twice the distance, and you will find out the
mistake under which you have been labouring.</p>

<p>It is on the nature of the metal that the goodness
of the shooting principally depends. That barrel
which is possessed of the greatest degree of elasticity
and tenacity, will throw its shot strongest and closest
with the least artificial friction. It is on the knowledge
of the qualities and temperatures of the various
irons, and on practice in the art of shooting, that a
man&#8217;s ability in making guns shoot with precision
must rest. All plans are merely methods by which
an unscientific maker has most frequently succeeded.
It would be no difficult task to produce a hundred
barrels which will shoot nearly alike; yet every barrel
shall be different in its bore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>The length of friction depends entirely on the
length of the barrel. Long barrels require more
than short, though the latter require it in a greater
degree. A mode of creating friction, much practised
by those who are ignorant of the true method, is to
bore the barrels as rough and as full of rings as
possible. These rings are often taken for flaws;
though that may be ascertained by noticing whether
or not they have the same inclination as the twist,
and whether or not they are at the jointing of a
spiral. If they be not, the chance is that the barrel
is ring-bored, as it is termed. This roughness,
however, answers the same as friction by relief; but
barrels thus roughened are very liable to lead, and
become foul. While the well-bored barrel will fire
forty shots as well as twenty, these cannot be fired
more than twenty times with safety and effect.</p>

<p>Each of the barrels in the table below, if 3-16ths
thick at the breech, is equal to the pressure stated.
The resistance of a charge of shot of one ounce we
find to be more than before stated; and the additional
increase of explosive force obtained at the moment
of ignition, requires the amount to be much greater
in computation, therefore, we may safely take a pressure
of 1,700 pounds to the inch of tube. The
reader will perceive, on reference to the following
table, that with the tube filled with powder for an
inch in length, which is a small charge, the explosive
force will be equal to 40,000 pounds, or nearly 1,700
pounds to the inch.</p>

<p>The foregoing tables show clearly the danger of
persevering in using heavy charges of shot; for it must
be borne in mind that accidental circumstances will
increase this pressure, and never can act so as to
lessen it: a foul gun, or a variety of other circumstances,
being sure to increase the danger.</p>

<p>Having fully explained the nature of gunpowder,
it remains to say something about the other portion,
namely, the shot. That a barrel creating explosive
force, until the charge is in the act of leaving the
muzzle, will shoot better than another which does
not do this, there cannot exist a doubt; for this is
the germ of the science. Also that the column of
air in barrels, where the explosive fluid is sooner
expended, acts upon the wadding, and influences the
lateral direction of the shot, there can also be no
doubt; therefore, more attention is requisite to this
point than is generally given. I am quite certain
that all well-constructed barrels, both as regards
metal and exterior shape, shoot best, shoot so longest,
and foul or lead less, than barrels having the aid of
friction: soft barrels require it, no doubt, but why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
make soft barrels? The others cost but little more,
and the superiority admits of no question. The
quantity of shot is a matter of the first consequence,
and I think that I have clearly established the fact,
that the less the weight, in proportion to the force,
the greater the speed or velocity given to that weight;
hence it follows that to be beneficial a certain quantity
is suited.</p>

<p>All guns, according to their bore and length, will
shoot a certain weight and a certain size of shot best.
A great deal of shot in a small bore lies too far up
the barrel, and creates an unnecessary friction; and
the shot, by the compression at the moment of explosion,
becomes all shapes: a circumstance which materially
affects its flight. If of too great a weight,
the powder has not power to drive it with that speed
and force required to be efficacious, because the weight
is too great in proportion.</p>

<p>Those who reason from mathematical calculation
will object to this doctrine. They will say, the
greater the weight the greater the effect. No doubt
it is so, if thrown with a proportionate force; but
that cannot be obtained with a small gun. We must
adapt the weight of projectile force to the power we
are in possession of; and from many experiments,
I am inclined to think, that a fourteen gauge, two
feet eight inches barrel, should never be loaded with
above one ounce and a quarter of shot (No. 6 will suit
best), and the utmost powder she will burn. A fifteen
gauge will not require more than one ounce; and no
doubt No. 7 would be thrown by her quite as strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
as No. 6 by the fourteen gauge gun, and do as much
execution at forty yards with less recoil. Setting
aside all other reasons, I should, on this account,
prefer the fifteen gauge-gun, if both be of a length;
as I find as much execution can be done at the same
distance with one as with the other. To render a
fourteen gauge barrel superior, Colonel Hawker is
right in stating, that it should never be under thirty-four
inches; which description of barrel I very much
approve. He also says, &#8220;You cannot have closeness
and strength in shooting combined, beyond a certain
degree:&#8221; an observation, in the truth of which I fully
concur; it being found that where there is a greater
degree of either strength or closeness, the other
requisite is always wanting. Neither would it be
advisable, as the sportsman will find a medium decidedly
the best: a medium that will give the shots
fairly spread over a space of thirty inches diameter,
at forty yards; and so regularly, that a space, which
would allow a bird to escape, shall not occur above
twice out of five shots, and each shot to penetrate
through thirty sheets of paper. It will be found,
that a gun doing this regularly, is far superior to one
throwing twice as close and not one-half through
the paper; as the latter will require four or five
pellets to kill a bird, when two of the other would
be quite as efficacious, on account of penetrating twice
as far.</p>

<p>In favour of small shot, Mr. Daniel&#8217;s observations
are so pertinent, that I cannot do better than quote
him. He says, &#8220;The velocity of a charge of No. 7<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
being equal (we will say nearly) to one of No. 3 at
that distance (35 yards), and since small shot fly
thicker than large in proportion to its size; and as
there are many parts about the body of a bird,
wherein a pellet of No. 7 will affect its vitality equal
to a pellet of No. 2, the chances by using the former
are multiplied in the workman&#8217;s favour; for it is the
number and not the magnitude of the particles that
kills on the spot. They who prefer large shot, and
accustom themselves to fire at great distances, leave
nearly as many languishing in the field as immediately
die. Whereas, those that use small shot,
and shoot fair, fill their bag with little spoil or waste
beyond what they take with them from the field.&#8221;
To an old gamekeeper of his (he tells us) he has
often put the question, &#8220;Why he was so partial to
small shot,&#8221; and his reply was, &#8220;Sir, they go between
the feathers like pins and needles; whilst the large
shot you use, as often glance off as penetrate them.&#8221;
No doubt, here Mr. Daniel is as correct as may be.
Mr. Blaine says, query? But he ought to be aware,
as I suppose he is, though allowing himself to lose
sight of principles, that small shot can be, and are,
propelled from the barrel with an equal velocity with
the larger; it is only in the length of range that the
greater triumphs; but if we take thirty or thirty-five
yards&#8217; distance as an average, the latter will not
&#8220;<em class="ital">lead</em>&#8221; in the race. Therefore, the advocates of
small shot have unquestionably the better of the
argument at this distance; at greater, I will not
dispute it, though I have picked up No. 5 shot 300<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
yards from the spot fired from; larger, No. 3, rarely
reaches 400 yards.</p>

<p>Hard shot is not so liable to be mis-shaped, nor
does it lose its velocity by contact, as easily as soft.</p>

<p>Under the head mixed shot, Blaine observes, &#8220;We
do not believe any law in projectiles can be brought
forward to prove its impropriety. The mass of shot
is propelled by the expansive power of the powder;
it is ejected in a mass; and when it separates, each
shot carries with it its own share of ejective force,
with very little interference with any other, it
being evident that the projectile force acting on
each shot is in the proportion of its area of dimensions,&#8221;
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Here is a great mistake. The law of projectiles
is not wanted to prove its fallacy; the laws of motion
will do that. If you take any number of equal or
dissimilar sizes of shot, and place it as a charge is
placed in a gun barrel, occupying <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> of an inch of
tube, there is, of course, a wadding between powder
and shot; this wadding is, or ought to be, a piston;
velocity is communicated to this piston by the explosion;
it does so to the shot immediately above it,
that to the layers above, and so on until the whole
mass is in motion. The velocity behind the piston
is increasing to a certain point, where it ceases; then
it is that the layer farthest from the piston, having
received its maximum from the layers below, travels
quicker than its assistants; who, having parted with
their force, fall behind in proportion: so does each
layer, even until the last one which received it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the piston, having communicated so much to his
friends before him, is left without himself. It is an
undisputed law in motion that one body may convey
to another, by contact, nearly its own velocity, but in
so doing, is sure to come to rest immediately. Strike
one billiard ball against another, if the blow is centrical,
the ball struck receives the motion, the other
comes to rest; and so is it with shot: it is only the
layers next the muzzle which strikes the target, the
remainder fall without travelling the same distance.
I have fired three balls from a rifle, and having
marked them I found the uppermost projected farthest,
and the others in proportion. This is easily
proved.</p>

<p>Thus, it is quite clear that in all charges of mixed
shot, the larger will extract the velocity from the
smaller, and consequently become useless for the purpose
intended: this fact is unquestionable.</p>

<p>In speaking of the longest duck or swivel guns,
I may instance Colonel Hawker&#8217;s account of the
performance of such fowling artillery. It appears
evident that they do not effect anything like the
execution which might be expected from their immense
size and capability. The reason of this is
obvious. From the great space of the interior, in
order to receive that equal pressure on the inch
which a common fowling-piece receives, they should
be charged in proportion to the increased size; but
then, I scarcely need add, they would become ungovernable.
In addition to this objection, they could
not be forged of malleable iron, so as to be safe; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
account of the impossibility of forging a barrel of that
weight by hand hammers, and the little probability
of hammers ever being invented to work by steam to
do it sufficiently quick. The greater the weight of
the barrel its strength is gradually decreased, owing
to the impossibility of sufficiently beating it throughout
the whole body.</p>

<p>It must be well known to any one versed in
mechanics, that an anchor-shank weighing some
hundredweights is more easily broken than iron one-twentieth
part of the weight, which has had the
advantage of being forged by hammers where the blows
were felt through the whole mass. This cannot be the
case in forging large barrels, as the workmen cannot
use hammers heavy enough; consequently the barrel
is turned out of hand with the pores more open than
a piece of cast iron. They have tried this with large
guns for the artillery, and it has repeatedly failed,
entirely from the want of sufficient power to compress
the iron.</p>

<p>All guns, therefore, of an unusual size, are not of
strength in proportion to a small gun; hence the
reason they cannot with safety be charged up to the
corresponding scale. Neither are they of the length
they should be, if the bore is to be the criterion. It
must be remembered that to be charged in proportion,
the pressure on the inch should be as many
times the pressure on the inch of the small gun, as
the one is the number of times larger than the other.
If we come exactly to the real state of the case, we
doubt much (when taking into consideration the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
of surface) that the pressure on the inch in
the large gun is equal even to that on a small gun.
The comparison might be carried up to the largest
artillery, and I doubt whether it would come up
to this scale; as it is well known that the heaviest
guns will not throw their projectile as far in proportion
as the small gun, because you dare not generate
the force required to do it. The same principle is
applicable to artillery as to fowling-pieces.</p>

<p>From the above data, I would say, never make
duck-guns above seven-eighths in the bore, if you wish
them to kill at a great distance; and not less than
fifteen or sixteen pounds weight, and full four feet
long; because then you can generate strength sufficient.
Therefore, instead of the large stanchion-guns
being one hundred pounds weight, they should,
strictly speaking, be two hundred, and so on. In
proof of this I may just mention that, upon repeated
experiments, I have ascertained that a double stanchion-gun,
with each barrel of the same bore, weight,
and length, as a single gun, will kill further than the
latter; simply owing to the advantage of the greater
weight of the double gun. I have made observations,
when trying moderate-sized and shoulder duck-guns
on that fine level piece of sand before spoken of, and
by tracing the grazing of the shots I have been
enabled to pick them up. The large shot from the
duck-gun, mostly No. 2, I found scarcely 400 yards
from the spot where she was fired; the small shot,
five and six, from a fourteen bore, were repeatedly
picked up at 350 yards: thus showing that the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
gun had not much advantage; but yet making probable
many assertions made of killing at seventy,
eighty, and sometimes a hundred yards, with a common-sized
gun. By this it appears possible; for shot
that will fly that distance must kill, if it hit during
its flight through the first quarter of such a range;
but then, at a single bird, above fifty-five or sixty
yards, it is always twenty to one against hitting the
object at all; as the pellets begin to separate rapidly
at that distance, though their force is still sufficient,
and in large flocks is apt to do execution.</p>

<p>The invention of the patent wire cartridge is rather
the production of a scientific mind than the production
of chance; though the invention of General
Shrapnell contains the principle, and the perfection
attained is but the extension of that principle:
namely, the means of projecting a number of bodies
of a similarity in size without subjecting them to an
extreme jamming by the lateral expansion, and thus
allowing each to travel his allotted distance without
any of his companions robbing him of his speed by
impact. The great peculiarity of the wire cartridge
is, that being less than the bore, and having no
bottom wadding, the explosive fluid acts all around,
between the sides of the barrel and the net, by what
may not inaptly be termed the windage, and the shot
are thus expelled by a cushion-like force, which does
not jam or compress them in the way it is liable to by
a wadding forcing it outwards. Here the net is of
use to keep the whole in a mass; but you must not
suppose the same would be obtained by a charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
shot, without a wadding below. The net opens, after
leaving the muzzle of the gun. The introduction
of bone-dust is intended for, and answers the purpose
of preventing the grains of shot being mis-shaped by
the compression: during their passage up the barrel
they form with the bone-dust a comparatively solid
body, and keep the pellets from impact, thus allowing
them to go forth into the atmosphere beautifully round
and uninjured; and, as such, more likely to travel
farther and stronger. The latter arrangement possesses
all the science, as the net can be dispensed with; for
it aids the combination but slightly, and in no case
more than a moderate quantity of good paper would do.</p>

<p>The science of this mechanical construction of projectiles
is perfectly in keeping with all the established
laws of motion, and more particularly good in thus
avoiding the necessity of lateral pressure on the sides
of the tube of the gun, the upper end having the
means of better resisting the column of air in their
progress outwards; for there can be no question but
this controls and induces the divergence of the shot
in leaving the muzzle. One of the old arrangements,
often laughed at, I mean the bell muzzle in old guns,
intimates that our ancestors possessed some smattering
of science; as the relief in the muzzle of a gun
has a tendency, by allowing a gradual expansion
laterally, to keep the charge of shot better together:
for it is quite apparent that any body severely compressed
for a certain distance, expands in proportion
when free of that restraint; and the consequence is a
tendency to fly off at a tangent, as the friction of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
crooked barrel induces a ball to fly in a curve contrary
to the bend of the barrel.</p>

<p>The extreme relief we find in some old barrels is certainly
not required; but still it clearly shows that the
principle was understood and acted upon: the very
extreme has been produced by ignorance, as certainly
as the suggestion was a proof of knowledge on the part
of the suggestor; for many think, if a small dose is
good for a patient, a large one must be equally so.
Like ourselves of the present day, having discovered
that fine gunpowder was advantageous, we have carried
the principle so far as undoubtedly to overstep
the line to which it was beneficial we should advance;
thus clearly establishing the truth of the old adage,
&#8220;One extreme begets another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore, in advocating the adoption of gun-barrels
of the very essence of iron, I also say, let that part of the
tube whose duty is the generating of force be nearly
cylindrical, and let there be a gradual expansion of
the bore for a few inches in approaching the muzzle,
that the restraint of the lateral pressure may not be
too rapidly loosened. But yet let that expansion be
so graduated that there shall not be an extreme either
way&mdash;only a scarcely perceptible relief; yet such as
will influence and prevent the divergence of the projectiles
to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>Blaine says&mdash;&#8220;A very long barrel is liable to have
the force of its discharge lessened by the increase of
counter pressure in the greater volume of internal
air in a long than in a short barrel.&#8221; The column
of air in the barrel is unquestionably calculated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
lessen the force of the discharge. But I have already
shown that this is completely controlled by the system
of granulation. Further, he says&mdash;&#8220;Its force must
also suffer by the loss which the elasticity of the propelling
gas experiences in its lengthened transit
through an extended range of barrel.&#8221; He is here
supposing an instantaneous generation of force, which
cannot possibly happen; and if it did, would be
comparatively useless. But he is evidently on the
right scent, if he could only follow it up. Again,&mdash;&#8220;In
such cases, it is probable, that the shot, which
should leave the mouth of the piece at the instant
when the propelling force has gained its maximum,
in a long barrel are detained beyond that particular
limit of capacity we have pointed out as inherent in
each barrel; and which properties, and which quantities
of charge, nothing but repeated and varied trials
can teach the owner of the gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is an excellent illustration of the &#8220;theory&#8221; of
the resistance of the column of air in long barrels
with very fine quickly-burnt powder; and could he
have pointed out the cause, the explanation would
have been perfect; as it must be quite apparent to
the reader that it is not the length of barrel which is
in fault, but a want of a continuous producing force in
the powder; for when all the charge is exploded, the
maximum has been obtained. This clearly proves
that the charge was too small to keep up that
maximum, or that the grain of the powder was too
fine, and thus too quickly expended. There is no
discrepancy between the fact of long barrels being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
preferable half a century ago, and short ones now;
for it is in the improvement of gunpowder burning
in half the time now that it did then, and leaves
the question of length of barrel precisely where it
has ever been. You may have any length you like
in moderation, if you suit the grain of powder to it.</p>

<p>I am quite satisfied to steer between extremes;
avoiding alike too small a charge of projectiles and
too wide a calibre with too heavy a charge of the
former, and preferring a size of bore that gives,
under all circumstances, the greatest range with the
least amount of explosive material; which neither
requires that to be too fine a grain, nor too coarse:
namely, a bore of fifteen and two feet six inches
long. Under all the above circumstances combined,
this size will long hold a position in the front rank
of sporting guns.</p>

<p>The Belgians have long been, and still are, our
principal competitors in supplying those parts of the
world which do not rank gun manufacturing among
their staple trade. The cost of labour being small,
they have great facilities for producing cheap material;
and the extent to which they tempt the eye
of those inexperienced in gunnery is quite obvious to
the world; but excepting the cheapness of the lower
grade of guns, the Belgian products are not at all
to be placed on an equality with the well made
English manufacture.</p>

<p>In consequence of the relaxation of our custom
laws, foreign gunnery is now admitted at ten per
cent. duty; and as soon as this change was made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the Belgians sent large quantities of their guns and
pistols to London; whence they found their way
through different parts of the country. Regular
establishments were opened for the sale of their very
highly ornamented barrels: ten different varieties were
produced, even to the imitation of laminated steel.</p>

<p>These barrels were at first sent in the bored and
ground state, in large quantities; their apparent low
price and great beauty quite captivated some of the
&#8220;Brums,&#8221; so that for a period they were all the rage;
and the Belgians began to boast of the extensive
trade they were doing. But nothing in this world
runs smooth. &#8220;The best laid schemes of mice and
men oft gang agee;&#8221; and so it was with the Belgian
importations. Our proof was not exactly to their
liking, or perhaps the iron was not equal to the
proof; losses and discoveries began to accumulate:
&#8220;Too soft, by far,&#8221; says one; &#8220;They are all plated,&#8221;
says another; &#8220;Filed it through, by jingo!&#8221; exclaimed
a third; &#8220;Common iron, by all that&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221;
protested a fourth; &#8220;Oh, twisted iron, under such
inimitable Damascus!&#8221; growled a fifth: in short,
steel over iron turned out to be the secret of the
whole business.</p>

<p>It is very probable that such facts as these soon
established the inferiority of &#8220;the beautiful Damascus
and arabesque&#8221; of the Belgian manufacturers; and
they have, I trust, disappeared for ever from the
English market: at least, they are not held in estimation
by those qualified to judge.</p>

<p>Their advocates have for years adduced the fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that the Belgian laws required guns to be twice
proved; and our old laws not requiring this, they
had certainly a tangible argument; but our improved
proof laws have now removed that anomaly, and
certainly our proof is now much superior, even to
that of the Belgians: so much so, indeed, that I have
now before me a letter from a Belgian barrel maker,
who, in reply to the inquiry why he did not send any
more barrels, says very truly, &#8220;your English proof is
too severe.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very carefully conducted experiment on at least
twenty best Belgian barrels, satisfied me of the indisputable
fact, that at least nineteen out of the twenty
were plated, and principally on twisted iron of the
softest description; as was shown by eating it entirely
away, by a lengthened immersion in a solution
of the sulphate of copper. This may be done in
the course of a few hours, leaving the Damascus,
and the arabesque plating comparatively untouched.
The production of that extremely beautiful figure
has to be effected by using metals of considerable
dissimilarity in their state of carbonization; the
iron evidently being entirely decarbonized before
mixing with the steel, and the steel even appearing
extremely soft; although, no doubt, much of this
would be effected during the heating of the barrels
to solder with brass: and it is well known this
cannot be done, except by heating them to nearly
a white heat.</p>

<p>As this is the universal practice with all barrels
which the Belgians finish, a good shooting gun is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
by all fixed laws of science, a scarcity with them.
But a point of still greater importance arises from
this injurious proceeding. In the act of heating
two tubes like gun barrels, it is an impossibility to
heat them equally, so that neither shall be at a
higher temperature than the other; and again in
lifting them from the furnace, and in cooling, all
are subject to bend by expansion and contraction
alone; the result is that perfectly straight Belgian
hard soldered barrels are utterly unattainable. To
an unpractised eye the bending in and out appears
trifling, but professionally, it is a very serious defect
indeed; and on that score alone, the Belgian can
never compete in quality with our own manufacture.
Time, however, will no doubt remedy this; already
they are great imitators, and they will, no doubt,
become greater. They are competitors whom respectable
manufacturers need not fear; and though they
eschew the imitation of our higher quality, they imitate,
even to the name, the &#8220;marks&#8221; of our leading
makers. I still would welcome and fraternize with
them, as highly skilled workers in elaborate mixtures
of metals suitable for ornamental gun-barrels.</p>

<p>The French gunmakers have not yet realized the
true value of the shooting of their fowling-pieces.
This arises, in a great measure, no doubt, from the
want of a proper field for improvement. Necessity
has always been an important improver, and wild
game creating the necessity for good guns in England,
a different direction has been given to the
manufacturer, owing to the continual cry for long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
killing guns; and not a doubt can exist that English
guns are better constructed for that purpose, than
those of any other country. Attention to the shooting
has always been the first study of every English
gunmaker, and great progress has been made during
the last twenty years; indeed, a comparison between
the largest &#8220;target&#8221; of to-day, and the best that
Colonel Hawker ever made with his crack Joe
Manton, will show a progressive improvement of
nearly 100 per cent., not only in closeness of shooting,
but also in penetration. All this may not be
due entirely to the gun, but in part to the gunpowder;
and to the sensible course we now pursue
of using less weight of shot, avoiding artificial friction
in the barrels, instead of increasing it to retard
the shot with the view of increasing its power: also
by having the expellant agent accelerative to the
greatest extent, closeness and strength of shooting
are obtained, with the least amount of recoil possible.</p>

<p>Our French competitors have paid much more
attention to the artistic decoration of their guns
than to their usefulness; and the universal result of
this sort of proceeding, ever since the invention of
gunnery, has been a total neglect of their power
of extreme projection. The metal, like other portions
of their work is, in all cases, manipulated with
a view to beauty only; as the fact of their veneering,
or plating, their barrels proves.</p>

<p>If at all masters of the science, they must be aware
that this weakens the shooting of the barrels, and
is an injurious practice. But the greater fact remains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
that they continue to fix all their barrels
together, by brasing them with brass from end to end,
as they do in Belgium; thus lessening the strength
of the barrels in point of safety, and nearly destroying
any smart shooting power they might have possessed.</p>

<p>The French appear to me to have only reached
that stage of progress which we attained forty years
ago, when every intelligent mechanic was seeking
after that &#8220;useless thing,&#8221; even when attained, &#8220;a
perfect safety gun;&#8221; which, from its complex character,
might have been designated &#8220;the dangerous
gun;&#8221; indeed, experience taught (though not without
great cost) that few would use it when attained,
and the consequence was that it fell into disuse.
Our Continental neighbours, however, are mining it
with great energy. A little more of our experience,
and they, also, will see the folly of the attempt.
All the facts go clearly to establish the truth of the
assertion, that for all useful purposes they are half
a century behind us in the essential part of gun
manufacturing. The anxiety shown by all leading
Continental sportsmen to obtain a first-class English
gun, and more especially of laminated steel, is very
strong evidence in support of this assertion. All
the guns I exhibited in Paris in 1855 were eagerly
bought up at high figures; and I have since executed
many orders for France, Austria, Prussia, Sardinia,
and Russia, as well as for other northern states.</p>

<p>The display of artistically constructed guns by the
French makers in their Great Exposition of 1855,
was very great, and by certain classes of sportsmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
would be considered superb. My notes, made at
the time of inspection, will show better than a
description can do, in what state of transition their
manufacture is, and how they vacillate between their
old and our present style:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Albert Benard, barrel-maker.&mdash;Iron very good,

and head receiving all the force of the recoil.</p>

<p>Lenoir, barrel-maker.&mdash;Iron very good; thirty rods

<p>Dufour.&mdash;All breech-loading guns; but all work
of the first class.</p>

well fitted and figure varying, but not possessing the
regularity observed in the Belgian barrels.</p>

<p>Chapellon.&mdash;Coutereau.&mdash;Exhibit some barrels

<p>Lefaucheaux, Paris, prize medalist, 1851.&mdash;Good
embossed work; breech-loaders; also very good imitation
of English work.</p>

<p>Such is a fair sample of the whole. But the best
work by far is that by Gauvain, though not so
highly estimated by the jury; but that is in many
cases no test of ability whatever&mdash;as much depends
upon the influence and standing of the individual.</p>

<p>Great exhibitions are calculated to effect great
good if properly carried out. In that of the English
exhibitors at Paris nothing could be more reprehensible,
for the jurors left them to the tender
mercies of their foreign competitors. In the case
of the gun-makers, nothing could be worse, for the
two jurymen appointed by the English Government
never, I believe, saw a gun, home-made or foreign; and
the fact of my obtaining two first-class medals speaks
much for the impartiality of our Continental brethren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Recoil.</span></h3>

<p>Recoil varies according to the position of the gun;
when fired on the horizontal, the resistance to be
overcome is the tendency of the projectile to fall
to the earth, and its friction as it moves in a line
parallel to the earth. When the muzzle is elevated
this resistance is increased, because the force generated
by the explosion of the gunpowder has to exert
its action more directly in opposition to the direction
of the force of gravity; and when this force is exerted
in a line directly opposed to the centre of
gravity, as it is when the gun is fired vertically,
then the recoil is doubled, and is made more painful,
because the body resting on the earth cannot yield.</p>

<p>A gun fired in the direction of the earth, or in
the line of the centre of gravity, would recoil much
less (perhaps fifty per cent. less) than when fired
vertically; from the very obvious fact, that if the
bullet was not kept in position by its friction on
the sides of the barrel, it would fall to the ground
of itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The recoil of a gun is inseparable from a discharge
of its contents&mdash;on the broad principle that
action begets reaction; it is, therefore, only when
the &#8216;kick,&#8217; as it is called, becomes painful, that
it is essential to avoid or lessen it. Irregularity in
the bore of the barrel is a very common source of
violent recoil; <em class="ital">contracted breeches</em> also, but more
than all, the contraction of the barrel at its centre,
occasion recoil, and that of the most dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
kind: the expanding flame, during its ignition,
presses violently to make its way through the contracted
to the wider part, thus also destroying the
expelling force. &#8216;Now, action and reaction being
equal, it follows, that the weight of the piece being
the same, the recoil will be in proportion to the
quantity of the powder, and the weight of the ball,
or shot; and that with the same charge the recoil
will be in proportion to the weight of the piece, or
the lighter the piece the greater the recoil.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Essay
on Shooting.</cite></p>

<p>Here is a true exposition of recoil, though not of
contractions in the breech; for there the action would
not be directly back, but have an inclination towards
the muzzle; for the reaction would not have time to
tell on the breech, before the charge was out of the
muzzle. An extremely spiralled rifle barrel destroys
the explosive force of gunpowder, but the effects
are not felt in the recoil, being most all expended
laterally. Blaine says, &#8220;Could we entirely obviate
all recoil from a gun, we should not only remove an
unpleasant shock to our persons, but there is reason
to believe we should much assist the range and force
of the shot likewise; although there is an opinion
prevalent, that the degree of the recoil is in the proportion
of the projectile force.&#8221; Of this, however,
some doubts are entertained, which are warranted by
the following fact:&mdash;&#8220;Mortars with iron beds immoveably
fixed in the earth throw their shot to greater
distances than guns which are affixed to carriages can
do, and which, therefore, can recoil. This has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
incontestibly proved, both in large and small artillery.
Having suspended a gun barrel, charged with a determinate
quantity of shot, from the ceiling by two cords,
so as to allow of its recoil, fire it point blank at a
target, and mark the result accurately. Now, fix
the same barrel to a block, and charge it exactly
with a similar charge; then having moved the target
fifteen yards further, fire the barrel; it is probable
that the last shot, though at this increased distance,
will exceed the former, both in range and force.&#8217;
These and such like experiments are laughed at by
the giddy and inconsiderate; but it is by these illustrations
that the most important facts are brought to
light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Projectile force is, therefore, to be increased by
resistance; and the knowledge of this fact offers us a
practical hint, that when we stand immoveable to our
shot, not only by holding the gun tightly to our
shoulder, but by also <em class="ital">leaning somewhat forward</em> in
our shooting attitude, we considerably increase the
resistance, and, consequently, we not only lessen the
shock of the recoil to ourselves, but we aid the force
of the shot and extend its range. That such is the
case, may be further exemplified by the following
experiment:&mdash;Throw a hand-ball against any moveable
body, and it will displace that body; but the
ball will drop to the ground perpendicularly, however
hard the body against which it is thrown may be.
Fix the same body securely, and then the rebound of
the ball will be nearly equal to the force with which
it was thrown.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>The weight or amount of force with which a gun
recoils against the shoulder, is due to, and regulated
by, several circumstances. The first and most important
is the amount of explosive force generated before
the charge is moved and during the act of moving,
and the amount of inertia in the body of the projectile.
When a quantity of gunpowder is exploded
without any resisting weight in front of it, then the
column of air gives comparatively a slight recoil;
though there is, in fact, considerable recoil, but such
as is due to the resistance of the air only, and, consequently,
more like a push than a blow. The exact
amount of recoil is also due to the difference between,
or proportionate weights of, the charge of shot or
bullet and the gun; action and reaction being always
equal until one or the other body moves; the division
then will be in favour of that moving fastest, and
hence the obtaining of accelerative velocity: it thus
follows, as a truism, that the smaller the quantity of
exploded gases that can be employed to first move the
charge, the less the recoil.</p>

<p>The advantage of the granulation system is here
again most clearly shown; and (alluding again to the
law of putting matter in motion gradually) if you
would gain the greatest benefit, it is clear that, in the
same length of tube, you would, at the termination of
the accelerative power, have gained a much greater
amount of velocity than could be obtained under any
other circumstances with the more violently explosive
gunpowder.</p>

<p>Many theories have been advanced, and many conjectures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
made as to the cause of the recoil of guns;
and it must be evident that the causes vary with the
form of gun, with the nature of the gunpowder, and
the weight; or peculiar arrangement of the shot or
bullet. For instance, an ounce of shot, and an ounce
of lead in the form of a round bullet, fired from the
same gun would give two very different amounts of
recoil, when measured by the spring cushion; the
ounce bullet not giving much more than half the
recoil produced by the ounce of shot. This is owing to
the simple fact that the bullet being a compact body,
offers only the resistance of its weight, and the simple
friction of sliding or rolling along the barrel according
as it is tight or loose; but the tendency of the
hundreds of shot corns is to &#8220;jam and wedge&#8221; in
the most extreme manner, offering, by their lateral
pressure against the sides of the barrel, the greatest
amount of friction and reluctance to be driven out:
hence the reaction on the gun, and thence on the
shoulder of the shooter; and the smaller the size of
shot the greater the jamming. Again, the same
weight of shot, fired from a 16-bore and a 12-bore
will recoil much more in the smaller than in the
larger bore, even when all other points are equal;
because the charge reaches higher in the 16-bore,
thus offering at first a greater amount of inertia.
Secondly, there is also more tendency to jam; and,
thirdly, the extension of the surface of lateral
pressure on the tubes of the barrel must also add
to recoil. Dirty guns, it is well known, kick
violently, simply from the greater friction, or difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of the matter of the charge being put in
motion.</p>

<p>The question as to what the actual amount of
recoil really is has never been settled satisfactorily;
the most erroneous opinions have been given, and
assertions equally erroneous have been made, by those
who have attended to the subject. To clearly elucidate
this question, it is absolutely necessary that the
circumstances be reduced to one standard: but the
difficulty is to obtain that; for it would vary according
to muscular development, the weight and height of
the sportsman. Indeed any principle laid down would
be liable to be disputed, from the very different way in
which every sportsman lifts his gun to his shoulder:
if one presses it against his shoulder with a pressure
equal to 5 lbs., he will receive a certain amount of
recoil; he that presses it with a force equal to 10 lbs.
will receive less; and with a pressure of 30 lbs. it will
be found to yield the least of all. I will illustrate it
in this way. Take a spring cushion (something like
the spring machine found at all fairs for testing the
force of a man pressing against it), if you allow a gun
to recoil against this when the starting pressure is
only 5 lbs., it will drive it up to 70 lbs., or nearly so,
from the velocity with which you have put the 7 lbs.
of matter which is contained in the gun into a long
sweeping blow. The next time you try, put the
starting point at 10 lbs., and you will find a much
less result in the extreme weight denoted; but carry
on this experiment, placing the cushion with a resisting
force of 30 lbs., and you will find the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
recoil indicated at from 40 lbs. to 45 lbs., and even up
to a higher starting resistance. But to this extent it
is not advisable to go, for the strain becomes too great
on the handle of the gun-stock, and there is too near
an apparent approach to a solid resistance, which it
is well-known would break the best stock that was
ever made.</p>

<p>Having shown how we may approximately obtain
the exact amount of force, and how it may, even with
two persons, give different results, I will now state
what I have found to be the result of many hundreds
of trials made with the view of deciding this question.
Before doing so, however, I will further premise that
hundreds of attempts have been made at various
times by different Governments, and by many talented
men, to obtain a correct recoil machine which shall
efficiently measure the recoil, and in such a perfect
line with the intended direction of the projectile as to
obtain accurate results: but this is found to be perfectly
unattainable, though I believe the nearest
approach to it has been made by Mr. Whitworth
during his experiments with the hexagonal rifle.</p>

<p>To prove that it is impossible to get all the circumstances
alike, so as accurately to ascertain the
exact force of the recoil, one instance only need
be cited. Fire your gun at a fixed object, then
fire at an object in motion, and to your senses
the recoil will appear double when fired at the fixed
object; but it is not really so: in the latter instance,
the body of the person firing the gun, and
the gun itself being in motion, a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
amount of the force of the recoil is absorbed in overcoming
the motion of the gun, and then that of the
shooters body, so that the effect is not noticed. I
have already alluded to the greater force of recoil felt
from the lighter pressure of the gun against the
shoulder; here the tendency of the gun and body
moving in one direction is to close them together,
and the proportion will be as the velocity of that movement.
Therefore, to bring this to a conclusion, I
find that under ordinary circumstances a 12-bore gun
of 7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lbs. weight, 30 inches in length, with a charge
of 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drams of No. 5 grained gunpowder, and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> oz.
shot, the barrels draw-bored cylindrically, with the
least possible easing at the breech ends, and metal of
the best laminated steel, will recoil with a force of from
40 lbs. to 48 lbs., or on an average 44 lbs.: this is the
most satisfactory conclusion I have been able to draw
from my experiments. This of course will vary, as I
have shown; and it is also liable to deviations, according
to the state of the atmosphere, and other collateral
circumstances. Great variations will of course arise
from guns of fine or rough insides; guns new or old,
well kept or neglected; and in guns bored larger at
the breech-ends, in order to give artificial resistance
to the escape of the charge. These last are now,
I trust, obsolete, except in that abortion of science
the &#8220;French breech-loading crutch gun;&#8221; and as an
exception, all ill-constructed guns.</p>

<p>The science of the question may now be regarded
as clearly established. Gun-barrels of the utmost
tenacity, with insides of a cylindrical form as true as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
possible, polished as fine as a mirror, with a moderate
weight of shot calculated to suit the gun and a good
charge of large granulated gunpowder, will give the
greatest killing power, with the greatest amount of
comfort, or absence of recoil, that is to be found in
the pursuit of shooting.</p>

<p>A point of considerable importance in obtaining
regular and good shooting&mdash;one, however, which is
frequently neglected&mdash;is that of ascertaining what
sized shot is particularly suited to the size of bore
used.</p>

<p>The correct adaptation of No. 5 or No. 6 for your
particular gun is easily attained. Place in the muzzle
an ordinary wadding, press it into the barrel the
depth of the diameter of the shot, which should be
exactly flush with the muzzle, place as many shot
corns on this as you can, without having more than
one distinct layer, and observe the size that best fills,
in concentric rings, the whole circumference of the
bore, leaving no half-spaces unfilled; note whether
it be No. 5 or No. 6 shot, and keep to that size for
your general shooting. Again, on other occasions
you may wish to use larger shot (Nos. 4, 3, or 2);
then ascertain by the same method which fills the
concentric rings most perfectly: the same should be
done with the smaller sizes, Nos. 8 or 9.</p>

<p>The rationale of this proceeding is that any half-spaces
are filled by shot from above pressed in upon
the lower layer, disfiguring itself and those it comes
into contact with; this is multiplied up to the 13
or 14 layers of which the charge is composed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the inevitable result is that four or five pellets are
pressed together until they adhere; either &#8220;balling&#8221;
or leaving empty spaces in the distribution of the
charge, to the injury of the gun&#8217;s shooting&mdash;a defect
which may easily be obviated by attending to the
instructions given above. One other point may be
observed, viz., that if 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> give 15<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> layers of shot
in concentric rings, the charge should be reduced
until the rings are complete, for the half-layer will
do much mischief by its unequal pressure on the
layers beneath it. And it is further necessary to
observe that in loading a gun, either with powder
or with shot, the gun should be kept as nearly in
the upright position as possible: the more upright
the gun is held, the more perfectly will it be charged,
and the more perfect will be its shooting.</p>

<p>A vast number of useless changes have of late
years been introduced into the construction of gunnery;
they have died, however, a natural death, as
they ought to have done, and have thus afforded
additional evidence that sportsmen of the present
day only adopt what are really improvements. Great
professional reputation in a gunmaker is not now,
as formerly, all that is required to command a trial
of individual plans of improvement: the improvement
must be self-evident; nothing being taken on
trust: a <em class="ital">bon&acirc; fide</em> benefit to the sportsman is essential
in the present day to obtain patronage.</p>

<p>There has lately been introduced a very novel
improvement in the construction of double gun
barrels, in order to overcome that defect long admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
to exist in firing the second shot. It has
long been known that in a 40 yards&#8217; flight, shot
falls several inches; and it is an established fact
that few sportsmen can kill with the second shot so
well as with the first, although it is certainly within
range of the gun. This no doubt arises in almost
every case, from the shot having fallen below the
object in traversing the greater distance; or, in
other words, the second barrel, in order to kill as
well as the first, ought be fired six inches higher;
but this the best shots find it difficult to do, and
it has therefore been proposed to do it for them.</p>

<p>Mr. F. W. Prince, of No. 138, Bond-street, has
patented an improvement to obviate this difficulty;
this he does by elevating or pointing upward the
second barrel, so as to cover the calculated fall in
the body of the shot; and the result is, that the
second bird is as well aimed at and as efficiently
killed as the first. The alteration is so exceedingly
simple, and the benefit resulting from it so apparent,
that the only wonder is that it should never have
been done before; and it being the improvement of a
really practical sportsman of the very first class, as
Mr. Prince has long been known to be, is sufficient
to stamp his invention as worthy of every consideration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="chapname">THE FRENCH &#8220;CRUTCH,&#8221; OR BREECH-LOADING
SHOT GUN.</span></h2>

<p>Sporting in France has never been brought to the
same state of perfection as in this country. Grouse-shooting
on our wild romantic hills is a very different
sport from quail, partridge, or rabbit shooting in the
vales and on the hills of the Continent. Wild game
requires great energy and perseverance on the part of
the sportsman, courage and strength on the part of
the dog, and last, though not least, great capacity on
the part of the gun. For many years the superiority
of the English manufactured gun, as well as of the
English gunpowder, and the matchless skill of the
English sportsman, have been acknowledged by all
the world. All things, however, have their limits&mdash;the
longest lane has a turning, and a very plausible
and insidious innovation has been made to detract
from the acquired reputation of the English sportsman,
and render his shooting inferior to that of some
of our friends on the other side of the Channel.</p>

<p>The French system of breech-loading fire-arms is
a specious pretence, the supposed advantages of
which have been loudly boasted of; but none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
these advantages have as yet been established by
its most strenuous advocates. How it is that the
British sportsman has become the dupe of certain
men who set themselves up for reputable gunmakers
I know not. It is certain, however, that by these
acts they have forfeited all claim to the confidence
of their too confiding customers, and that they never
could have tested the shooting properties of their
guns. With regard to the safety of these guns,
they display an utter want of the most ordinary
judgment; and this is abundant proof that they
considered neither their safety, nor (what is also
of importance) the economy of the whole arrangement,
as regards their manufacture or their use.</p>

<p>Guns are perfect only so long as they possess the
power of shooting strong and close, with the least
available charges. The period has passed when
barrels were bored by rule of thumb, without any
well-defined intention; the workman being ignorant
as to whether he would have the bore of the barrel
cylindrical, or (as was frequently the case) in the
form of two inverted cones, and thus he continued
to bore at the barrel until it was utterly useless,
or until by chance he hit upon a tidy shooting bore.
Barrels are now constructed so nearly alike, that it
is no stretch of truth to assert that ninety-six or
ninety-eight barrels out of a hundred can be made
so nearly alike in their shooting, as to render it
very difficult to discover the real difference between
them. Yet, in the face of this high state of perfection
certain English gunmakers introduce, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
recommend to their patrons as an improvement, a
description of gun possessing the following negative
qualities:&mdash;First, there is no possibility of a breech-loader
ever shooting equal to a well-constructed
muzzle loader; secondly, the gun is unsafe, and
becomes more and more unsafe from the first time
it is used; and, thirdly, it is a very costly affair, both
as regards the gun and ammunition. Nor are these
negative qualities at all compensated for by any of
the advantages claimed for these guns by their advocates;
this assertion I now proceed to establish.</p>

<p>In the first place recoil has been an important
obstacle to contend with, ever since the invention of
fire-arms, and the methods of lessening recoil have
engaged the special attention of all inventors up to
the present day; on this important point, indeed,
very much depends. Gunnery is good only when
recoil exists in a minimum degree. Force, whether
it be that of the gentle &#8220;zephyr,&#8221; or of the mammoth
steam-boiler which is capable of moving thousands
of tons, can always be measured, and the
friction of steam against the tube through which it
passes can be measured also.</p>

<p>The time was, when guns were so imperfectly
constructed, that the recoil and friction of the charge
against the barrel destroyed more than half the
force generated by the explosion of the gunpowder;
and this loss of force having been obviated, by finely
polishing the interior of the barrel, as well as by
improving the metal of the gun, has rendered English
guns superior in their performance to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
manufactured in any other country. Breeches of a
conical form offer the greatest resistance to the
action of a&euml;riform bodies in a direct line; this is
the principle of what is best known as &#8220;the patent
breech:&#8221; to speak of which would be a waste of time,
as nothing more is required to support its superiority
than the fact, that in well constructed artillery
of every country, the interior form of the breech or
chamber is more or less conical. Thus we see that
by adopting the crutch gun, we have to give up one
of the oldest and most universally acknowledged principles
in lessening recoil&mdash;namely, the conical form of
the breech&mdash;and to adopt the very reverse of this:
namely, the old right-angled, flat-faced breech, upon
which recoil can exert its utmost force with the certainty
of its reaching the shoulder of the unfortunate
user.</p>

<p>Secondly, to enable the gun to be loaded with a
cartridge which shall keep its place, a complicated
arrangement is necessary. On inspection of the barrel,
it will be perceived that a cavity has been formed larger
than the bore of the barrel, and that this in some
cases only tapers toward the further end. This cavity
exactly receives the cartridge, and the gunpowder is
inflamed in a space much larger than the barrel, which
it has afterwards to pass through. The charge of shot
is also started in a larger space than that which it
afterwards has to traverse, and the column must of
necessity become contracted and elongated before it
can escape from the barrel. The first consideration
is at what cost of force is all this effected? Thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
per cent. would certainly be a shrewd guess; and
who is there conversant with the nature of gunpowder
hardy enough to gainsay the fact?</p>

<p>I here present the reader with the measurement
of a pair of barrels&mdash;bore 12, diameter of the cavity
10, or two sizes difference,&mdash;tried at the celebrated
trial of Breech versus Muzzle-loading fire-arms, which
took place in April last, in the court at Cremorne.
The following are the results of the trial:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Class 1 comprised twelve bore double guns, not
exceeding 7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lbs. in weight; the charge for the
breech-loaders was three drachms of powder, and one
ounce and a quarter of shot; that for the muzzle-loaders,
two and three-quarter drachms of powder,
and an ounce and a quarter of shot. The question
will be asked why were both not charged alike? and
the answer is, because the advocates for breech-loaders
well knew the loss of power caused by the
enlarged breech end would require a larger quantity
of powder; yet, with this advantage, the result was a
verdict in favour of the muzzle-loaders of nearly
two to one. I quote from the <cite>Field</cite>. The aggregate
number of pellets in the targets from breech-loaders
was 170, the penetration 19. The aggregate number
of pellets put in by the muzzle-loaders was 231, the
penetration 48; and this was effected with a quarter
of a drachm of powder less.</p>

<p>Few will doubt that this must be the inevitable
result. Force cannot be expended and retained:
we &#8220;cannot eat our cake and have it.&#8221; If force is
destroyed by friction, it is as useless as if it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
never been generated. So much, then, for the shooting
qualities of the breech-loader.</p>

<p>And now comes the question, of much more importance
than the shooting qualities of these guns:
namely, can all this force&mdash;30 per cent., in fact, of
the whole charge&mdash;be thrown away with no worse
result than the mere wasting of the powder? Is
there no change taking place in the barrel of the gun
every time it is discharged? Iron and its combinations
are as certainly limited in their duration as
is human life itself. Every bar of iron is capable
only of resisting a certain amount of pressure; every
successive strain on its fibres deteriorating it more
rapidly; and whether it be the mainspring of the
lock, or a gun-barrel itself, a certain number of
strains will destroy it. This being the case, how
much more rapidly must a breech-loader be destroyed
where 30 per cent. of the charge is always &#8220;absorbed&#8221;
on the sides of the barrel in the cavity alone. This
a lengthened experiment will prove; though the fact
is so self-evident, that no experiment is required to
demonstrate it.</p>

<p>Caution in gunnery is absolutely necessary under
the most favourable circumstances, and disregard of
perfection in the construction of a gun is quite
unpardonable; then what shall be said of that member
of society who, with all those facts before him,
can say to his customers, &#8220;I advise you to have a
breech-loader: they are really good guns?&#8221; In what
estimation such a tradesman must be held I will not
venture to say. Much more might fairly be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
against these guns, but I sum up the whole in the
following damnatory sentence: Breech-loaders do not
shoot nearly so well, and are not half so safe, as
muzzle-loading guns.</p>

<p>It is said, and truly, that a breech-loader can be
charged more rapidly than a muzzle-loader; but I
hold this to be no advantage, for this reason: all guns
can be loaded more quickly than they are fired, and
the tendency of all barrels to absorb heat, puts a
limit to rapidity of firing; indeed, after ten rapid
shots with each barrel, both guns would be about on
an equality. Another question is, can breech-loaders
be used longer than muzzle-loading guns, without
cleaning? My opinion is, <em class="ital">they cannot</em>. At the trial
already spoken of, after twenty-two shots had been
fired from the breech-loaders, the cartridge-cases had
to be extracted from the barrels with a hook, and in
several cases it was necessary to cut them out with a
knife; whilst a muzzle-loading gun without friction
would have gone on to a hundred shots without being
wiped out. There are few plans or presumed improvements
which have not some redeeming points;
but in the case of breech-loading fire-arms it is quite
a task to find even a resemblance to one. All the
advocates for breech-loaders whom I have ever met
with yield, with this acknowledgment: &#8220;I must
admit that I never liked them; but so many gentlemen
are asking for them that I was compelled to
make them, to keep my customers.&#8221; This is, no doubt,
the truth; but it is calculated to lead to serious
calamities: for it was apparent to hundreds, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Cremorne trials, that even the best and newest breech-loading
guns permitted an escape of gas at the breech
to an extent that I never thought possible; and if
this occurs in new guns, what will happen after a
single season&#8217;s shooting, should any one be found sufficiently
reckless to use a breech-loader so long?</p>

<p>No fear need be entertained that the use of breech-loaders
will become general; manufactures on false
principles soon show themselves worthless, however
pertinaciously they may be puffed off. The
number of accidents arising from the use of breech-loading
fire-arms has not been very great as yet;
though I have already heard of several very serious
cases, from the use of well-made guns: let us consider
what would be result if the workmanship was
inferior?</p>

<p>There is one other point to which I may briefly
allude before dismissing the breech-loader to the
&#8220;tomb of all the Capulets.&#8221; The majority of guns
on this principle merely abut against a false breech;
and, from the fact of there being no connection either
by hook or by cohesion, the explosion causes a separation
between the barrel and the breech to an extent
which would scarcely be credited. This may, however,
be satisfactorily demonstrated by binding a small
string of gutta percha round the joint, when after
explosion the string will be found to have fallen in
between the barrel and the breech; thus showing
that the muzzle droops in the act of being discharged,
which must must materially influence the correctness
of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>The recoil of an ordinary 12-bore gun, loaded at the
muzzle, varies from forty to forty-eight pounds, seldom
exceeding the latter; that of a breech-loader varies
from sixty-eight to seventy-six! And this quite independently
of the enormous force which is exerted on
the sides of these enlarged breech guns. The shoulder
left in the barrel, too, is a formidable barrier for the
charge to pass by; and, in doing this, the circle of shot
in immediate contact with the barrel becomes disfigured
and misshaped, so as to insure its flight only to
a very short distance. In the muzzle-loader an average
of 180 shots strike a target of two feet six inches diameter;
but breech-loaders of the same calibre will
rarely put in 120 shots; showing a clear loss of 60
pellets. This is due to the enormous jamming they
have undergone in passing from the greater to the
lesser area of the barrel. It is said that the paper of
the cartridge fills up this enlargement; but any one
who knows what the force of gunpowder is, must also
know that paper intervening between the charge
and the sides of the barrel would be condensed at
the moment of explosion to one-fourth its original
thickness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="chapname">THE RIFLE.</span></h2>

<p>The Rifle has at length taken its place among scientifically
improved weapons. Mathematicians laboured
long and earnestly to develope the important principles
involved in it, and which lay hidden like latent heat,
only waiting for the moment when they were to be
extracted, as they were at length by experiment, the
result of necessity: indeed necessity has done more for
the improvement of gunnery than all the mental toil
and labour bestowed on the science itself. The
philosopher has sought in vain for that which
mechanical skill unpatronised and unheeded forced
upon the world, and that, too, in spite of prejudice and
contempt; and the present generation see improvements
brought out which were predicted generations
before&mdash;as the following quotation from Robins
clearly shows:&mdash;&#8220;Whatever state shall <em class="ital">thoroughly
comprehend the nature</em> and advantages of rifle pieces,
and having facilitated and completed their construction,
shall introduce into their armies their general
use, with a dexterity in the management of them,
they will by this means acquire a superiority which
will almost equal anything that has been done
at any time by the particular excellence of any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
kind of arms, and will perhaps fall but little short of
the wonderful effects which histories relate to have
been formerly produced by the first inventors of fire-arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the result here predicted has now been obtained
no one can doubt. Greater extension of range
is yet attainable; but accuracy of range amounts
already to almost mathematical precision. All that
is now required is, that the same principle should be
applied to the heaviest projectiles; and when these
are projected under precisely the same laws, experience
will further establish this principle, that &#8220;the
heavier the body in equal velocities the less the
deflection from atmospheric resistance.&#8221; When this
is demonstrated the present order of things will be
reversed; heavy ordnance will exceed the shoulder
rifle in extension and accuracy of range, whilst the
shoulder rifle will again fall back to its former state
of comparative inferiority.</p>

<p>Barrels were first grooved or rifled at Vienna, about
the year 1498. The original object of grooving or
rifling the barrels was to find space for the reception
of the foul residue produced by discharging the rifle,
and thus to diminish the friction of the bullet as it
was forced down by the ramrod. During the next
twenty years a spiral turn was given to the groove, and
bullets were used with projections to fit the grooves,
the degree of twist or spiral varying as the skill of
the gun-maker thought best.</p>

<p>The difficulty of loading rifles has at all times been
a drawback to their universal adoption as warlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
weapons, and it has been reserved for a humble
individual to achieve that which all the talent devoted
to it for three centuries had hitherto failed to
accomplish.</p>

<p>A multitude of claimants have &#8220;put in their
plea&#8221; for a share in some part of the invention; and
it may benefit not only the present but also the
future generation, if we give a succinct account of
the approaches made by different men towards the
present established principle, and show the bearing
each had in bringing about the revolution that has
taken place in the science of gunnery.</p>

<p>The earliest notice of an elongated bullet is
Robins&#8217;s &#8220;egg-shaped,&#8221; which gives to the hemispherical
end the centre of gravity, thus establishing
the first essential principle; but theory and practice
were here sadly discordant, for its wild uncertain flight,
caused by the small end acting as a rudder, rendered
his theory useless, and it soon died of a natural death.</p>

<p>The next innovation on the spherical principle of
bullets was the attempt made by the late Sir Home
Popham to introduce elongated sphero-cylindrical
bullets into cannon, with grooves and projections on
the exterior to impart a spinning motion, which
should be sustained by the action of the atmosphere;
but this, like Robins&#8217;s idea, survived only a very short
time. The next in rotation is a description given by
Captain Beaufoy, in his work on the rifle called
<cite>Scloppetaria</cite>, and published, we believe, in 1808.
Captain Beaufoy gives a drawing of an elongated
bullet one and a quarter diameters in length, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
a hemispherical cavity accurately corresponding in
shape to its counterpart at the opposite end. &#8220;This,&#8221;
he states, &#8220;he had heard was beneficial from the fact of
the rush of atmospheric air into the vacuum created,
thus inducing a forward motion by the kick <em class="ital">&agrave; posteriori</em>.&#8221;
This apparently was but a surmise, an idea
never carried out, for in the same work a degree of
spiral grooving is advocated with which the action of
this bullet, had it ever been intended to be expansive
in principle, would be quite incompatible.</p>

<p>Next comes the celebrated Joseph Manton with his
invention, intended to give a spiral motion to the
ball by the cup of wood already described under the
head of <a href="#Page_146">rifled cannon</a>. This very idea has since been
revived by General Jacob; and in 1822 Captain
Norton introduced to the notice of the Government
his &#8220;Rifled Shell&#8221; for the explosion of an enemy&#8217;s
tumbrils. This was of necessity an elongated hollow
bullet, containing a small charge of gunpowder, which
was ignited by the explosion of a cap on a nipple,
screwed into the fore-end of the leaden shell.</p>

<p>Here, no doubt, was a partially expansive bullet;
for the bullet would be driven in upon itself, and thus
expand from the weakness of the hollow shell; this
near approach, however, to the invention was not
intentional: the sole object in view was the action
of the shell, and no more importance was attached
to its expansion, in Captain Norton&#8217;s estimation, than
to the bullet described by Captain Beaufoy in his
<cite>Scloppetaria</cite>. It is only within the last few years
that some friend, with more acumen than the gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
officer, discovered his near approach to the subsequent
invention, and a claim has been made on his behalf
which he himself never dreamt of, during the many
years we were battering at the doors of prejudice;
closed as they were against military innovation.</p>

<p>In 1826, Capt. Delvigne proposed to use an elongated
bullet: &#8220;having observed that when a bullet was forced
in by the old system of the mallet, its diameter was
increased perpendicularly to the axis of the barrel, he
came to the conclusion that by giving a chamber to
the breech of the rifle, and loading with an elongated
bullet having just sufficient windage to enter freely,
two or three taps from a steel ramrod would flatten it
sufficiently to make it take the form of the grooves,
into which it would certainly penetrate when fired.&#8221;
This contrivance was, however, found to be useless
for military purposes; for after a trial, extending over
two or three years, by the Garde Royal in Algeria, it
was given up in 1830. This, then, is clear proof of
an attempt to construct an expansive bullet, and conclusive
evidence also of its failure.</p>

<p>From 1830 to 1839, no evidence can be found of
any progress having been made by these inventors.
In 1836 I had the honour of producing the first
perfect expansive bullet. During the winter of 1835
and the spring of 1836, I made an extensive series
of experiments in order to overcome the effect of the
very extensive windage existing in military muskets
at that time; better known in the present day by the
name of &#8220;Old Brown Bess.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mean diameter of the bore was &middot;760, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
diameter of the bullet was &middot;701, or of the better understood
gauge of 11 and 14 bore, thus leaving more
than three sizes for windage. To obviate this great
discrepancy by expanding a bullet from 14 to 11 bore,
so as to destroy the windage, was the first consideration;
and, indeed, the first great step towards that
change of which we have as yet only seen the beginning.
I here give a representation of my first attempt,
and the observations made upon it in 1841:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Five years ago I perfected and laid before the
Board of Ordnance a new plan or system of constructing
expansive balls, which is accomplished by
having two dissimilar portions. An oval ball with a
flat end and a perforation extending nearly through,
is cast; a taper plug with a head like a round topped
button is also cast, of a composition of lead, tin, and
zinc, as below.</p>

<table id="Fig27" summary="Table page 343">

<td class="caption nowrap">EXPANSIVE BALL<br />BEFORE USING.</td>
<td class="caption nowrap">EXPANSIVE BALL<br />WITH PLUG DRIVEN HOME.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The end of the plug being slightly inserted into
the perforation, the ball is put into the rifle or
musket with either end foremost. When the explosion
takes place, the plug is driven home into the
lead, expanding the outer surface, and thus either
filling the grooves of the rifle, or destroying the
windage of the musket, as the case may be. The
result of this experiment was beyond calculation; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
for musketry, where the stupid regulations of the
service require 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> sizes of bore difference for windage,
it is most excellent, as remedying this considerable
drawback upon the usefulness of the arm; the facility
of loading being as great, if not greater, than by the
present practice.</p>

<p>Inventions, however, are of no use whilst kept in
obscurity, and my first and natural course was to
bring it under the notice of the parties for whose
benefit it was intended. Accordingly, in July, 1836,
a memorial was duly drawn up, and laid before the
Master-General and Board of Ordnance, soliciting a
trial. After overcoming some difficulties, a trial was
ordered at the &#8220;cost of the inventor,&#8221; and in August,
1836, it took place at Tynemouth, in Northumberland,
under the command of Major Walcot, of the Royal
Horse Artillery, a party of the 60th Rifles being the
firing party. The exact form of the memorial, and
the points claimed by the inventor, are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangind">&#8220;To the Right Honourable the Master-General and Officers of His
Majesty&#8217;s Board of Ordnance. The humble Memorial of
William Greener, Gunmaker, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, humbly
sheweth<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;That your memorialist has, after considerable trouble and
expense, discovered a method by which the facility of loading all
rifles, muskets, and other small fire-arms will be much increased, as
well as a considerable additional force or range of the projectile be
obtained, even with a less quantity of powder than at present used.
Your memorialist has frequently loaded one of his Majesty&#8217;s rifles
by this method, as quickly as any soldier could load the plain
musket, and the balls when fired have received the same or greater
effect from the action of the grooves of the rifle. Your memorialist&#8217;s
plan simply consists in the manufacture of a more ready
kind of cartridge, which will answer for all fire-arms as at present
constructed, and will also be a considerable saving to his Majesty.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Your memorialist being aware, from former communications
with your Honourable Board, that in no case is any sum of money
allowed for travelling expenses, &amp;c., and your memorialist being
very far from rich, is unable to attend any committee, either at
Woolwich or elsewhere, your memorialist, therefore, suggests that
if it meet the approbation of your Honourable Board to issue an
order to the officer commanding the depot of his Majesty&#8217;s 1st
Brigade 60th Rifles, at present stationed in this town, or to any other
regiment or detachment in the neighbourhood, to appoint a squad of
men to fire 100 rounds of memorialist&#8217;s and 100 rounds of the
cartridges now in use, and to compare their respective merits, the
whole to be provided at your memorialist&#8217;s expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;And memorialist, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</p>

<p class="rightsig">&#8220;<span class="smcap">William Greener.</span>&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>The success of the experiments far surpassed the
expectations of the military men present; and that
they fully established all the points claimed, will be
evident from the following secret report made by
Major Walcott to the Board of Ordnance:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I then examined Mr. Greener&#8217;s ammunition, and found he had
not made it up into complete cartridges, but that his ball was separate
from his powder. I then examined the ball, which being less
than the barrel of the rifle, went down very easily&mdash;indeed slided
down, and is thus formed. The ball is cast with a hollow in it, to
which a plug of the same metal is inserted, but not going home.
The force of the charge is said by Mr. Greener so to act on this
hollow ball as to expand it, filling up the whole barrel, preventing
all windage, and so truly keeping its flight that the head of the plug
first striking the object fired at, is then driven home; the ball
becomes a solid, and as such is equal to the present mode, as well
as having more force and with a less quantity of powder than at
present used.</p>

<p>&#8220;A detachment of the 60th was then ordered to load with Mr.
Greener&#8217;s, and an equal number with his Majesty&#8217;s practice ammunition.
The first certainly had the advantage in quickness of
loading, but this may be accounted for by Mr. Greener&#8217;s ball being
put in separate from the cartridge; for I am by no means certain
(it being necessary that his plug should be exactly in the centre,<span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
either next the cartridge or from it) whether, when made into a
complete form, should the plug have shifted from its position, it
would not cost the soldier more time to place it right; neither am I
certain whether the plug might not be liable to become jammed in
the soldier&#8217;s cartouch-box.</p>

<p>&#8220;After firing several rounds, at 200 yards, at the target, we
succeeded in obtaining some of Mr. Greener&#8217;s balls, one of which
that had struck the target and did not go through I send (marked)
as the most favourable specimen of the day&#8217;s practice, the plug
being driven hard into the ball, the others having lost their plugs.
Mr. Greener, whose wishes I complied with in every way I could,
then proposed firing a number of rounds into a sandbank, to show
that the plugs did not quit the ball. A great many rounds were
fired; in many the plugs were out, in many loosely fixed and
easily removed, and in a part firm. Not having the advantage of
the target I had desired him to bring, a number of rounds were
fired at the rifle&#8217;s extreme range, 350 yards, as the best means
left of ascertaining the difference of range; the only result of which
was, that it appeared invariably to me and others on the slightest
resistance from the first the plug quitted the ball, and therefore
must have lessened its force from loss of weight. The balls from
both charges, Mr. Greener&#8217;s and his Majesty&#8217;s, went home to the
target, but only one of the latter went through. I had then fired
most of Mr. Greener&#8217;s cartridges and balls, and fifty rounds of the
practice ammunition of the 60th. I beg to submit with the greatest
deference that in so great a change as this proposed, even should it
be considered worthy any other trial, that the specimens I shall
send up by the earliest opportunity may have competent examination&mdash;for,
although the balls of Mr. Greener bear the impress of
the grooves of the rifle, I am not able to state whether such may
not equally well be produced by the action of being forced from
the rifle as by the expansion Mr. Greener states to take place&mdash;should
the Master-General deem it necessary that any further
experiment be made by me and with cartridges properly made up.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The immediate result was a very pithy epistle from
the Secretary to the Board, saying, that &#8220;in consequence
of the bullet I had submitted being &#8216;<em class="ital">a
compound</em>,&#8217; it was totally unfit for his Majesty&#8217;s
service, and no more trials could be allowed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>This, in 1836, was the universal mode of proceeding,
as subsequent events clearly proved; whether
from inability on the part of the constituted military
science controllers, or from a fixed determination to
reject all improvements from civilians, I knew not;
but time explained it all, as the sequel will show.</p>

<p>The total destruction, in 1841, of the small arms
department in the Tower of London, together with
all the arms it contained, opened a vista to improvement
both in the principle and mechanical construction
of &#8220;Old Brown Bess.&#8221; This opportunity was
not lost. A series of letters, Nos. 1 to 6, appeared
in the <cite>Times</cite> in November and December, 1841,
urging the necessity of a radical change in the
construction of military arms, if the nation was still
to hold its high military prestige. The sensation
created at this time was immense, and no doubt laid
the foundation stone for that change which has rendered
English arms superior to any in the world,
instead of being, as they formerly were, inferior to
any in Europe.</p>

<p>In one of those letters, which may still be found
in the <cite>Times</cite> of December 25th, 1841, the following
account is given of the progress I had made in the
invention since 1836; and when the form and proportions
of my expansive bullet of 1841 are contrasted
with the present and the original form adopted by our
Government from the French of Captain Mini&eacute; in
1849, it must strike the reader as being so palpable a
copy as to leave no ground for argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;One favourite suggestion of Hutton&#8217;s has hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
been strenuously rejected, even by those to whom his
recommendations have, in other respects, been laws&mdash;viz.,
his plan of using &#8216;oblong bullets.&#8217; Some years
ago I laid before the Board of Ordnance a very
simple plan of getting rid of all windage, yet of
loading easily, and adding to the weight of the projectile
(a favourite theory with the artillerists). This
was effected by employing an oblong ball of lead &#8216;<em class="ital">a
diameter and a half in length</em>,&#8217; having a perforation
extending through two-thirds of it. An iron plug
of a conical shape is slightly inserted into this perforation,
and the gun loaded with it. When the
explosion takes place, this plug is driven home into
the lead, and, by expanding its outer surface, the
projectile comes out of the gun fitting as tight as
possible, and a line of flight is given to it of corresponding
accuracy. The advantages of this arrangement
are numerous, but, in naval warfare, of the
most important nature, giving heavier metal with
smaller rates, and from the composition and shape
of the projectile combined, producing a corresponding
destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the authorities laid the plan upon the shelf,
where it will rest until produced by some more important
personage than myself. The poor inventor
obtains but poor encouragement, while his more
wealthy competitor is enabled to have every opportunity
of trying schemes which, in most cases, are
not worth the consideration of any, save the friends
of the party.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1842, powerful influence being brought to bear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
it was hoped that a trial of my invention would result;
and in order to meet the strongly expressed public
opinion, the Board of Ordnance ordered me to construct
them model arms on my own principle. This
was done, and the trial promised by the Master-General
was demanded, but as obstinately refused by
the Select Committee at Woolwich, whose power was
superior to that of the Master-General; though he
was fully pledged to afford me a trial.</p>

<p>Thus the progress of invention was delayed until
1848; sometimes enlivened, however, by the bursting
of a shell of intelligence in the camp of military prejudice.
Slashing letters appeared from time to time
on military incapacity. Meanwhile Captain Delvigne
and Captain Thierry continued their experiments,
and on June 21st, 1842, a patent was obtained in
France, which is thus described:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;For having hollowed the base of my cylindro-conical
bullet, not only for motives mentioned in the
descriptive memoir given with my demand for a
patent, but besides to obtain its expansion (son
&egrave;panouissement) by the effect of the gases produced
through the ignition of the powder. By this means
the effort of the powder itself, which formerly caused
spherical bullets to deviate from the grooves, now
contributes to force the bullets of my system more
firmly into them.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a paper published by M. Delvigne in the
<cite>Spectateur Militaire</cite>, of August, 1843, we also find:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;In order to avoid too great friction I grooved the cylindrical
surface of the bullet; but, whilst I thus increased the windage of<span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
the body of the projectile, I reserved, at the two extremities of the
cylindrical part, two circular rings of a diameter almost equal to
that of the calibre. These two rings fixed accurately in the bore,
secured the perfect position of the axis of the bullet, which the
blow of the ramrod then forced tightly. In case of foulness, they
easily gave way to the blows of the ramrod, and the axis of the
bullet remained in the required position. The hollowing of the
sides of the bullet gives besides the means of fixing on the cartridge
without increasing the diameter of the calibre. But during these
investigations, <em class="ital">I made an important discovery, which was, that the
gas produced by the ignition of the powder, rushing into the vacuum
formed at the base of the bullet, expanded it and forced it into the
grooves</em>. I here give the idea, a new one, as I think, and recommend
its application to such as occupy themselves with the effect of
fire-arms and powder. The following, however, must be avoided:
if the hollow is too deep, the expansion is too great, and the consequent
friction enormous; sometimes even the gas will traverse the
bullet, and consequently the projectile is deprived of a proportionary
amount of velocity; if too small, the expansion does not
take place.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>In 1847 and 1848 Captain Mini&eacute; makes his first
appearance on the boards; and he proposed a hollow
iron cup to fill up the cavity in Delvigne&#8217;s bullet, and
from this circumstance we get the name of Mini&eacute; rifle.</p>

<p>The serious defects in our arms were now, however,
becoming so glaring, and the disgrace of getting
worsted in skirmishes with contemptible foes in the
Cabul and Caffre wars, as well as nearer home in the
Mediterranean, raised public indignation against the
military arms department; and this indignation reached
such a pitch that an immediate change was called for.
The so-called invention of Captain Mini&eacute; offered
itself, and was immediately adopted, though the very
same thing had previously, on two occasions, been
rejected at my hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the history of the rifle is brought up to the
adoption by the Government of my principle, under
the name of the Mini&eacute; rifle; and the validity of the
pleas on the part of the several claimants for a share
in the invention has been succinctly stated.</p>

<p>During the succeeding years I several times made
unsuccessful attempts to obtain from the English
Government a recognition of my claim to the invention.
True it is that insult was not added to injury,
for they did not tell me I had no claim as an inventor,
but they sheltered themselves under the political plea
of &#8220;Oh, my dear sir, the injustice did not occur
under our Administration, or we should be so happy
to remedy it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Time went on, and war came at length, and
brought with it proof that but for my invention we
should have been ill prepared. &#8220;The queen of
weapons saved the fight:&#8221; so said the Thunderer.
&#8220;When war&#8217;s wild din was done,&#8221; the poor inventor
was listened to.</p>

<p>The first step taken was through Mr. Scholefield,
the member for Birmingham, who moved in the House
of Commons for copies of the correspondence between
myself and the Board of Ordnance in 1836, and the
papers therewith connected. Thus an act of glaring
injustice was exposed, and there was evidence of proceedings
having been enacted over which I would
rather draw a veil. The authorities were no doubt
shocked at the injustice which the poor inventor had
met with at the hands of the then Board of Ordnance.</p>

<p>Thus I obtained the Secret Report, which elevates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
so high the names of those who could designate a
plan as &#8220;useless and chimerical,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which was destined
eventually to create greater changes in gunnery than
it had undergone from its earliest invention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honour to report that, in obedience to your
minute, dated the 22nd inst., I assembled the Select Committee for
the purpose of considering a new invented cartridge for rifles, made
by Mr. William Greener, gunmaker, of Newcastle. Patterns of
these cartridges, with a report from Major Walcott, Royal Horse
Artillery, of a day&#8217;s practice with them at Tynemouth. Several
balls that have been discharged at and collected after that practice
were submitted to the Committee, who, after an attentive consideration,
is of opinion that the ends purposed by Mr. Greener
have not been accomplished; that his plan <em class="ital">is useless and chimerical</em>.
The Committee do not, therefore, recommend any further trial in
the terms solicited by Mr. Greener in his memorial of the 6th inst.</p>

<p class="rightsig">&#8220;<span class="smcap">William Millar</span>, <em class="ital">Dep.-Adjut.-Gen.</em>&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>I then disputed the fact of its being a French
invention before the juries of the French Exposition
in 1855; there, however, my evidence was inadmissible,
from the fact of it not having been exhibited,
and the invention not being a recent one. In spite
of all this, I still persevered; and my next step was
to submit the subject to royalty. I first submitted
it to the Emperor Napoleon, who carefully investigated
the facts of the case, and admitted the Englishman&#8217;s
priority. Eventually the British Government,
after much trouble, also admitted the fact, (though
not until after it had been submitted to the successors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of the original select committee) and awarded me the
sum of 1,000<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr> in the army estimates of 1857.</p>

<p>It is a fact, which all will acknowledge, that the
principles involved in an invention should be best
known to the inventor himself; and if he is unable
to explain the very principles of such invention, then
it is quite fair to presume that he was not the original
inventor.</p>

<p>Now there is no evidence that either Delvigne or
Mini&eacute; had any profound knowledge of the science
of gunnery, and their knowledge of the principles
of the expansive rifle was so meagre as to justify the
assumption, that their only connection with its production
was that of copying from the <cite>Times</cite> newspaper,
or from my works published in 1842 and
1846. My observations certainly appeared before
any of theirs; and I believe that no straining of
facts can in any way connect them with the invention,
which was as perfect in 1841 as when they
reproduced it in 1848 and 1849.</p>

<p>With these remarks, I pass on to what is of more
importance, viz., the principle of the expansive rifle.</p>

<p>It had long been known that to give a spiral
motion to a bullet in a direction coincident to its
line of flight, was the standard of perfection in rifle
projectiles; but this, until the invention of the
expansive bullet, could never be attained with safety.</p>

<p>Spheres receiving this motion are not likely to
retain it, because the periphery of the spherical
bullet is, in all cases, subjected to much more friction
than the rest of the sphere; a change would therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
certainly be induced, the axis of the spinning
motion being changed from one coincident to the
line of flight to that of one vertical to the same.
The two grooved rifle was an illustration of this;
for in all cases the projections on the bullet induced
a change, the ring of the bullet revolving parallel to
the horizontal line, as I predicted in 1841.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to point out the prejudicial
action of any projections on projectiles, both as
regards their accuracy and length of flight; perfect
smoothness of surface being, in fact, absolutely necessary.
Lengthened study and a series of experiments
with bullets of a sphero-cylindrical shape having
grooves and projections on their exterior identical
with the grooving of the interior of the barrel, led
me to consider the production of a bullet with a considerable
cavity (equal, in fact, to two-thirds of its
length) at the same time adopting as a standard one
and a half diameters in the length of the bore of the
gun; thus the thickness of the metal between the
apex of the bullet and apex of the cavity was nearly
one half of the diameter, as the following diagram
will show.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo379.jpg" alt="Greener's bullet" width="350" height="271" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>This enabled me to insure two important principles,
on which depended the success of the whole
invention. 1st. The centre of gravity was in the
head of the projectile. 2nd. &#8220;<em class="ital">The force was communicated
directly to the centre of gravity during
the explosion.</em>&#8221; This is a most important principle,
which all writers presuming to give their version to
the theory of the expansive system, have entirely
overlooked.</p>

<p>If the arrow could receive the propelling force in
the head, its motion would be even, and free from
&#8220;hobbling,&#8221; as Roger Ascham wishes it to be; but
if, on the contrary, it is received at the opposite
extremity, then there is a struggle between the head
and the tail, as to which shall be first, and a
&#8220;wobbling&#8221; motion is induced, enduring until an
equilibrium of velocity is established.</p>

<p>It is essential to all future progress in the science of
projectiles, that this point should be remembered, and
its importance duly estimated; and it is possible to
apply this principle to projectiles of any weight.
If this point be attended to, where is the difficulty
in extending the length of our projectiles to that
of arrows? thus increasing their range indefinitely.
There is, in fact, no law to limit the length of
expansive bullets: the only limit to their length
now is the tendency of lead to squash; but alloys
of lead and other metals may yet be beneficially used
for projectiles, and that to an extent of which at
present we can form no conception.</p>

<p>The range of vision of the human eye being inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
to the range of the rifle will probably be the only
limit to its use; and this range will not be difficult
to attain: reduction in the size of bore enables us to
elongate the bullet without diminishing its weight or
the accuracy of its range; but without the existence of
a cavity to insure the force being applied to the head
of the bullet, this cannot possibly be done; whilst all
other shapes are limited in their application, and an
extension of range cannot be obtained with them.</p>

<p>Next to these two important points in the invention
comes the question of expansion, whereby the
grooves of the rifle are filled up with lead, and
windage is as far as possible obviated. The expander
I first employed consisted of a tapering piece
of iron, similar in shape to the frustum of a cone,
and this, when inserted into the cavity of the bullet,
was flush with the bottom of the cylinder. The force
generated by the ignition of the charge was exerted
equally on the plug and on the leaden cylinder; the
plug, however, moving more rapidly than the lead, is
driven quicker into the bullet, the bullet expands, and
thus the filling up of the grooves is accomplished.
There can be no doubt that at the same time an
upward force is exerted by the plug on the leaden
bullet; and that, too, of a more elastic character than
would be exerted by the gases themselves, if they
were allowed to act directly with all their force upon
the lead; for it is a fact beyond all dispute, that any
force tending to set matter in motion gradually is
more effective than that which is instantaneous in its
action.</p>

<p>Many writers condemn <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</i> the Mini&eacute; principle
and its cup. Mini&eacute; did not understand it; and the
introduction of the cup by him was, I believe, an
accident, or the best he could do by copying my mode
of using it: it was not the production of his own brain.</p>

<p>It has been urged as an argument against the use
of this cup, that sometimes expansion does not occur.
This, however, may easily be accounted for by the fact
that the cup is not tightly fitted into the cavity of the
bullet; a space is left through which the elastic fluid
penetrates the cavity, the cup then has as much pressure
exerted upon it behind as in front, and hence
it remains undisturbed.</p>

<p>Then the cup is sometimes driven in so violently
that it becomes flattened against the flat surface of
the upper portion of the cavity, cutting the lead so
entirely as to leave the cylindrical portion of the
bullet in the breech of the gun; this is well known
to have been a frequent occurrence on the first introduction
of this bullet. These defects are instanced,
as evidence to show that Mini&eacute; and others have no
claim whatever to the production of the original
idea&mdash;they cannot even now grasp it, but condemn it,
because it is beyond the limits of their comprehension.
True it is that, after blundering for several years, our
Government have come back to my original idea, as
the following quotation will show:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Hay,&#8221; says Sir Howard Douglas, &#8220;has
introduced an important improvement in the shape of
the cup, and in the figure of the cavity into which it
is forced on the firing of the charge. It will be perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
that the cavity in the Mini&eacute; shot has the form
of the frustum of a cone, while that of the cup is a
hemisphere: now all who have examined the shot
picked up after having struck an iron target or penetrated
into the earth, find that the hemispherical cup
is very liable to be canted or turned instead of being
forced directly into the hollow space; the lead of the
shot is not driven equally into the grooves of the
rifle. For this evil Colonel Hay has proposed a
remedy, in giving both to the cup and the cavity
in the shot conoidal forms; by which means the
former must, by the force of the powder, proceed
directly forward in the hollow space, and thus uniformly
expand the lower part of the shot in the
bore.&#8221;</p>

<p>If this is not conclusive evidence of the priority of
my invention, then I cannot understand the English
language.</p>

<p>The next object I sought to obtain in the invention
was a reduction of opposing surface, and an
increased momentum. The law of atmospheric resistance
is as the area of displacement, and the velocity
with which that displacement is effected. Thus, a
spherical bullet of one ounce weight displaces a bulk of
the atmosphere equal to the area of its hemisphere;
whereas an elongated bullet of the same weight would
have to displace so much less as is the difference
between their diameters. These two bullets, started
at equal velocities, are acted upon very differently by
opposing forces; the velocity of the spherical is diminished
much sooner than that of the elongated bullet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
on account of its greater diameter: hence the increased
range of the elongated bullet. Let us suppose an
extreme case. Take a bullet produced from a description
of hardened lead five diameters in length, and
presenting to the atmosphere one-fifth the surface of
a spherical bullet of equal weight; the reasonable
assumption would be that this bullet would range a
greater distance if projected at the same velocity, and
if the same charge of gunpowder be used as with a
spherical bullet.</p>

<p>The first series of experiments clearly established
the fact that increased range could be obtained, and
also with a vast reduction in the charge of gunpowder:
with a saving, in fact, of nearly 50 per cent.
Two drachms and a half were found equal to a range
of fourteen hundred yards, whilst four drachms and
a half on the old system would rarely reach half that
distance. These important points were gradually
developed, though not without many disappointments
and much mental anxiety: the last discovery, to
have rendered the task easy, should have been the
first.</p>

<p>Extreme spiral curve in the rifle barrel is incompatible
with the correct action of the expansive
bullet. The old-established turns of one in four feet,
one in three feet, and one in two feet nine inches,
gave results in the order I have placed them; and it
was not until the adoption of a spiral approximating
to one turn in five and a half up to six feet, that
I found the success of my experiments uniform:
and this fact illustrates one great obstacle which my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
invention had to contend with before it was generally
adopted.</p>

<p>The ordinary sporting rifles have invariably too
much spiral; the amount of friction generated by an
expansive bullet in a rifle of this construction is
enormous, absorbing in many cases one half the
power of the expellant. The result of this is most
unsatisfactory: the bullet suddenly loosed from this
immense friction, and freed from the column of air
in the tube, rushes so wildly forward as entirely to
destroy equilibrium in its flight; and hence the very
loud complaints of disappointed experimenters.</p>

<p>The expansive principle now adopted combines
such qualities that, however long and loudly it may
be condemned, it will again assert its superiority,
and hold undisputed the first place for generations to
come. It is based on that law of nature which will
always tell in mechanical productions; namely, minimum
of friction, and hence maximum of propulsion
or velocity; the greatest possible range with the least
amount of expellant agency. The same law holds,
even though the bullet should be elongated and made
into an arrow. That which has been introduced to
the world as an improvement on my invention, and
modestly termed the &#8220;Pritchett bullet,&#8221; I rejected in
1841 as being inferior to the expansive bullet: any
one who is curious, and wishes to be convinced of
this fact, will find the following quotation in the
<cite>Naval and Military Gazette</cite> for February, 1842:&mdash;&#8220;A
great improvement may be effected by using
plugs of a cylindrical shape, having the upper end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
round, and the part next the powder flat or concave;
for rifles, to be of use, must be constructed for
high velocity, and this can be done by a proportionate
spiral and the use of a plug similar to that given
above. In this case we may load with the greatest
facility, and the bullet expanding, forces itself into
the grooves of the rifle, and thus receives the modicum
of spiral motion required.&#8221; A perusal of
&#8220;Captain Jervis on the Musket Rifle&#8221; would lead
one to infer that this was a great invention on the
part of Mr. Pritchett, and that it would supersede
to a certainty the more perfect expansive bullet; but
Mr. Pritchett&#8217;s so-called invention has sunk into
oblivion, from whence it will never emerge.</p>

<p>From practice I found that the most material defect in
this bullet was its uncertainty of action: it was driven
in upon itself, and thus its diameter was increased. A
slight difference in the hardness of the lead, a bullet
moulded when the metal was hot, and the reverse,
would be such insuperable difficulties as to render
their adoption quite impracticable; moreover, when
rapid firing became necessary, the enormous friction
created by the heat and hardness of the previous
deposit from exploded powder, rendered the use of
these bullets highly dangerous; as was proved in
the Crimean war. I trust they are now for ever
abandoned, for their adoption did not show great
intelligence on the part of their advocates.</p>

<p>The expansive principle not being adopted in the
armies of France and other Continental nations, may
be justly attributed to the experimenters of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
school having been led astray; claiming, as they did,
the entire merit of the invention. It is but fair that
whilst endeavouring to establish my own claim to the
invention, I should point out the discrepancies existing
in the theory of my opponents.</p>

<p>That considerable imperfections exist in the expansive
rifle used in France, is evident from the results of
their experiments, and the time which has been wasted
in discussing the principles necessary for correcting
the flight of the bullet by &#8220;annular rings&#8221; being
applied to its cylindrical part.</p>

<p>Captain Tamissier&#8217;s theory is &#8220;that an elongated
bullet in passing through the air, describing the curve
of the trajectory, maintained its axis parallel in its
successive positions to the position it had at starting,
and that the angle formed by this axis with the
element of the trajectory&mdash;that is, the direction of
the motion&mdash;changed every instant. The action of
atmospheric resistance would also be altered by the
surface presented by the projectile; as the point
of application of this force would not always pass
through the centre of gravity, but would establish
a rotatory motion different from that with which the
bullet was originally animated: in different words,
the bullet, by preserving its original position, would
after a time be pursuing its path with its broadside
foremost; that is, with the point of its axis
above the line of the trajectory and the near end
below.</p>

<p>&#8220;To remedy this, and increase the precision of fire
with these bullets, Captain Tamissier thought it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
necessary to create resistances to the atmosphere as
far as possible behind their centre of gravity, in order
to bring the point of the bullet back to its original
course. For this purpose he formed a number of
circular grooves on the cylindrical part of the bullet,
in imitation of the feathers of an arrow; which, he
says, are placed at the hinder part to engender
resistances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The folly of such a theory must be very apparent
to a practical man. The engraving below of a bullet
obtained direct from Captain Mini&eacute; in December,
1855, and with which the troops were then experimenting
at Vincennes, when compared with my bullet
of 1843, renders any further argument unnecessary.</p>

<p>With this I contrast my bullet of 1841, at <a href="#Page_354">page 354</a>,
and a very slight inspection will be sufficient to satisfy
any one of its superiority: every practical rifle-shooter
knows that the smoother all the surfaces of the bullet,
the more extensive and accurate is the range. That
the French experiments should have given unsatisfactory
results I am not at all surprised: the flat
surface on the point of the bullet must offer a
large space for the resistance of the atmosphere,
during 1,000 yards of flight. Then to this must be
added the effect produced by the rings around the
bullet; and when the resistance of the atmosphere
and that produced by the friction of the bullet are
added together, we need not be surprised that the
results of the experiments turned out very unsatisfactory.
Surely, if the French school invented the
bullet which produced this wonderful revolution in
gunnery, they would have rendered it perfect, instead
of producing it in a more rude state in 1848 than
I had produced it in 1840.</p>

<p>Another point affording strong evidence that the
whole was copied from my work of 1842, is this. In
my original plan the bottom of the cavity of the bullet
was flat, exactly as it now appears in Captain Mini&eacute;&#8217;s
annular ringed bullet. In 1843 this was changed
into a hemispherical bottom; and this exists in all
English expansive bullets, as the adjoining <a href="#Figp365">woodcut</a>
will show.</p>

<p>In 1852 I produced a new form of cup, intended to
obviate the use of the heavier substance, or conical
piece of iron. In addition to a cup of a parabolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
spindle shape, it had a rim like that on a man&#8217;s hat,
as the woodcut will show.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Figp365" id="Figp365"></a>
<img src="images/illo390.jpg" alt="Expansive bullet" width="150" height="347" />
</div>

<p>A great advantage is gained by this contrivance in
effectually expanding the bullet, and thus closing up
stray appendages, which are found to exert considerable
influence on the ultimate direction of the bullet.
A slight tail of cartridge-paper, a string, or an
appendage of any description, exerts such an important
influence on the bullet&#8217;s flight, as to cause it in
some instances to describe a curve, the termination of
which is very eccentric, and commences from the very
base of its starting. It is evident, then, that great
accuracy is necessary in order to produce a perfect
expansive bullet. English bullets are pressed into
shape by machinery, whilst in France they are formed
in the ordinary mould; this, however, is at all times
an uncertain mode of making them: a slight cavity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the head of the bullet would make it eccentric in its
flight; and this is very difficult to avoid: a slight
puncture, or an eruption on the surface, would, during
a lengthened flight, be materially acted upon by the
atmosphere, so as to influence in a great degree the
direction of its flight.</p>

<p>The scientific world is deeply indebted to General
Jacob, of the Scinde Horse, for the zeal and energy
he has displayed in carrying out his principle of
projectiles. He experimented on a scale never
before attempted by any private individual; his
explosive projectiles have created universal interest,
and the great ranges he obtained will hand down
the General&#8217;s name in the history of gunnery to
all future generations.</p>

<p>Whilst ascribing all credit to General Jacob for
the benefit he has bestowed on projectile science, it
is not less my duty to point out how unfortunate for
science, and for the General&#8217;s scientific reputation,
were the defects which exist in the system of which
he is so strenuous an advocate.</p>

<p>General Jacob&#8217;s principle differs from mine as
widely as the poles are separated from each other. In
mine there exists the least amount of friction, the
minimum of spiral motion, and a most extensive
range, with the smallest expenditure of expellant
force.</p>

<p>In the General&#8217;s invention these points are exactly
reversed: friction is at the highest point, the degree
of spiral in the groove is more than double, and the
charge, as a matter of course, is much greater. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
range is greater, no doubt; as it ought to be, being
obtained at treble cost. Cost, in all cases, is the key
to success or failure; not cost in a monetary sense
only, but cost of wear and tear. Destruction of the
barrel, and the amount of buffeting by recoil, are
points of cost; and the principle of General Jacob
is so nearly allied to that of the &#8220;hexagonal&#8221; rifle,
that many will think, and perhaps not without good
reason, that the one has given rise to the production
of the other. The great length of column, 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
diameters in height, is so extreme, as to be evidence
in itself of the very unsound principles on which this
rifle is constructed. When bullets composed entirely
of lead are used, the result is that the bullet is so
driven in upon itself, as to upset the whole structure,
&#8220;swaging&#8221; it whilst in the barrel into a long cylindrical
tube of lead, as the <a href="#Figp367">wood-cut</a>, exhibiting the
bullet before and after firing, will sufficiently explain;
whilst the friction and lateral pressure on the tube
of the barrel, which must be necessary to effect the
change in the bullet, require no further comment.</p>

<p>Thus departing from the true science of the question,
instead of giving the centre of gravity to the
head of the bullet, he tries to overcome the difficulties
by which his system is beset, by increasing the spiral
motion. As other writers take a similar view of
the question, I insert the following quotation from a
small work by Lieutenant Simons, Bengal Artillery,
entitled &#8220;A Treatise on Fire-arms,&#8221; where we have
the following appropriate remarks, strongly bearing
on the peculiarities of this system:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Every point upon the surface of a projectile in
motion, whether it be a rocket, javelin, ship, bullet,
arrow, or any other description of projectile, is the
end of a lever, the fulcrum of which is situated in
the projectile&#8217;s centre of gravity. The effect of the
air to upset, <i>i. e.</i>, to force the light or pointed end of
such projectile to the rear, or to unsteady, or cause
to waver, the same, depends upon the lengths of the
levers at the ends of which it acts, and upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
angles at which it presses against such levers, as
determined by the positions of the points and by the
shape of the projectile; it likewise depends upon the
specific intensity of the pressure, which is doubtless
greatest in the neighbourhood of those parts of the
projectile which least easily allow the air to escape
past them.</p>

<p>&#8220;An illustration in part of the truth of the foregoing
proposition will present itself to the conceptions
of those who have taken notice of the manner of the
flight of rockets, or who have witnessed shells projected
from mortars at night time. The light of the
burning fuse, particularly during the first part of the
flight of the shell, is seldom obscured from the sight
of the beholders in the battery from which it is fired.
The end of the fuse protruding beyond the general
surface of the shell is the end of a lever whose
fulcrum is the shell&#8217;s centre of gravity. The pressure
of the air against this lever as the shell moves
forward, drives it to the rear, in which place it would
remain steady, did the shell in its course describe a
straight line; a curve, however, being the line
actually described, it follows that the direction from
which the resistance created by the shell&#8217;s own
motion comes, is ever varying; whereby the occurrence
of an equilibrium is prevented, and the shell
is caused to oscillate laterally as it were. If the size
of the fuze end of it, however, be at all considerable,
the shell will rarely topple over, and, in consequence,
the light of the fuze, during the ascending curve, will
generally be visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The more rapidly a ball is made to reach its
goal, the nearer will the line described by it approach
to a straight one, and the less will it roll. It is
possible that the old musket-ball did not roll much
during the first fifty or hundred yards of its flight,
and that the accuracy of shooting with it will have
been less on this account. A ball which does not
roll, may be said to be &#8216;in position;&#8217; there is
inherent in it a fixed tendency to deviate from the
line in which it is projected. Now a shell which
rolls much by reason of its comparatively slow motion,
is ever tending to stray in different directions, and,
therefore, a movement in the wrong direction, at one
moment, being compensated for the next by a corresponding
movement in the opposite direction, it may
be by this means a recipient of an amount of accidental
compensation to which, perhaps, the musket-ball
is a stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such being the manifest effect of projections
upon the surface of a shell, it is not difficult to
imagine what must be the unseen effect of projections
on the surface of a rifle ball. One projection, placed
without regard to effect upon such surface, would
make the ball jog and oscillate much after the
manner that has been described. Two or more of
proper form and construction will, on the contrary,
if properly placed upon a projectile, hold it steady,
and so impart to it a fixed tendency to digress,
thereby preparing it to be usefully operated upon by
spiral motion.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much as has been said will, I think, suffice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
disprove that not unfrequently entertained notion to
the effect that the light end of a bullet is kept forward
by the operation of the spiral motion imparted
to it. I could cite more than one person and
pamphlet (General Jacob), apparently under the
influence of this belief, but which certainly does
not accord with theory, and the practical incorrectness
of which was thus manifested to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Whitworth rifle, which was introduced to the
world with a clarion flourish from the <cite>Times</cite>, has
not made any very rapid progress toward perfection.
It still drags out an existence, it is true, but its
boasted superiority is all a myth; as time and experience
will show.</p>

<p>Like the former, but more meritorious, invention of
General Jacob, it is based on an unsound principle,
an untenable theory, good only in seeming, which
collapses when grasped by the hand of practical
experience.</p>

<p>The peculiarity connected with this weapon is the
extraordinary circumstances under which it first saw
the light:&mdash;It was produced by the aid of Plutus,
dragging in reputed science to fashion on the instant
a weapon superior to the tardy results of three
centuries; though during that period numbers of
talented individuals had devoted their lives to the
study of gunnery.</p>

<p>Wealth is generally believed to be able to remove
all obstructions, and even to purchase capacity, if need
be; though it can scarcely enable one individual to
surpass the experience of ages, however talented that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
individual may be. The attempt thus to obtain such
assistance was a slight by the Government of the
day to the improvers of British fire-arms; they were
passed over as of no value, and the country&#8217;s wealth
was thrown into the lap of a talented, but at the same
time, not a practical man.</p>

<p>The Government of this country had on all previous
occasions exacted from inventors their brains
and their money, as an offering in exchange for
patronage; on this occasion, however, they departed
widely from their usual custom, for the &#8220;mountain
came to the mouse.&#8221; It would have been a grateful
compliment if the Government had said to the inventor,
&#8220;You have done something for the good of your
country with your limited means, here are thousands
of pounds at your command; do something better, for
we need it.&#8221; But nothing of the kind was done: a
selection was made, justified by no antecedent qualifications.
The first thing necessary was the acquirement
in a very short time of a practical knowledge of
gunnery, in order that a weapon should be produced
superior to any other; but whether success has
attended these efforts or not is still doubtful, and
this is in itself a fit rebuff to the Minister, who
expected, like the citizen&#8217;s wife, that &#8220;gold would
purchase capacity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great defect in the hexagonal-bored rifle is the
extreme amount of friction, and the consequent useless
expenditure of means.</p>

<p>The bullet is produced in the most accurate manner
in a lathe, and is composed of an alloy of lead, tin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
and manganese, so as to render it hard enough to
resist the tendency to squash or swage; which is the
case in General Jacob&#8217;s principle. The angles on the
bullet are cut with the greatest precision, in order to
fit the groove of the barrel; constituting, in fact, a
female screw of two turns in every thirty-nine inches
of length.</p>

<p>As fair play has always been my motto, I am
actuated by no other desire than that of enabling
the reader to form a true conception of the intricate
nature of projectile science; and though the eulogium
bestowed on the inventor&#8217;s own creation is rather
egotistical, I give it entire, dissecting it afterwards in
the manner I think most conducive to a correct knowledge
of the real science of gunnery.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;THE WHITWORTH AND ENFIELD RIFLES.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the last few days a very interesting and important series
of experiments has been in progress at the Government School of
Musketry, Hythe, in order to test the comparative merits of these
two rifles. The trial, which was of the most searching and impartial
character, was conducted by Colonel Hay, the able head of
the school, and has terminated in establishing beyond all doubt
the great and decided superiority of Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s invention.
The Enfield rifle, which was considered so much better than any
other as to justify the formation of a vast Government establishment
for its special manufacture, has been completely beaten. In
accuracy of fire, in penetration, and in range, its rival excels it to a
degree which hardly leaves room for comparison.</p>

<p>&#8220;The following table gives the best results that have been
obtained from 10 shots of each arm respectively, in the course of
the experiments, which have extended over a week in time, and
were brought to a close yesterday in the presence of Lord Panmure
and of a number of military and scientific spectators:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It would appear from these figures that at 500 yards in 10 shots
the Manchester rifle has a superior accuracy of 1&middot;87 of a foot; at
800 yards 3&middot;11; at 1,100 yards 5&middot;63; and that at 1,400 yards
and upwards the Enfield weapon ceases to afford any data for a
comparison. In penetration the results obtained have been equally
decisive; the Whitworth projectile, with the regulation charge of
powder, going through 33 half-inch planks of elm, and being
brought up by a solid oak bulk beyond, while the Enfield ball
could not get past the 13th plank.</p>

<p>&#8220;The shooting on Tuesday was more to satisfy Lord Panmure and
the other strangers present upon the comparative merits of the two
weapons than to show the limit of what each could do under
favourable circumstances. Still, the targets of every 10 shots on
either side bore decisive evidence of the superiority of the new
rifle, as a glance at the following table will prove:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The last entry in the table records the mean radial distance
from a central point of 10 shots fired from a table-rest, by Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Hay and Mr. Gunner, the manager of the Enfield factory. Both
are first-rate marksmen, yet at 500 yards the Manchester rifle in
the hands of the former gives three times as good shooting as the
latter can get out of the Government arm. All the other trials were
made by firing from a beautifully-constructed machine rest, which
placed both weapons on a footing of perfect equality as to the conditions
under which they were tested. In addition to the foregoing
experiments, there was one for showing that with cylindro-conoidal
balls on the expansion principle of those used for the Enfield
rifle, very superior shooting could be obtained from Whitworth&#8217;s
hexagonal bore. This was most satisfactorily established, the mean
deviation on the target from the centre of the group of 10 hits being
only &middot;85 of a foot at 500 yards&#8217; range. It will be observed that at
500 yards&#8217; range, at which the practice commenced, the shooting of
Whitworth&#8217;s rifle was so much better than the other that no greater
distance was attempted. A reference to the first table of experiments
will also demonstrate that the target made by the former
weapon at 1,100 yards is nearly as good as that made by the latter
at 500. These are great results to have achieved, and amply justify
the forethought of the late Lord Hardinge in securing the services
of so eminent a mechanic as Mr. Whitworth for the improvement
of the rifle. Until he took the subject in hand the proper principles
for guidance in the construction of the weapon had not been accurately
determined. The manufacture was still conducted by rule of
thumb, and in a very hap-hazard way on the most important points.
The use of grooves and an expansive projectile made it impossible
to secure the requisite amount of pitch in the rifling and the indispensable
hardness of metal in the bullet for penetration. Moreover,
from the small amount of bearing, the wear and tear both in the
barrel and in the projectile were enormous, and the length of the
latter could not be increased without causing it to capsize in its
flight. By the polygonal bore and rapid pitch to which the form of
the bullet accurately conforms, Mr. Whitworth has rendered stripping
impossible, and, his rifle when fired acting exactly like a male
and female screw, the projectile must rotate with perfect steadiness
and precision on its axis. He can increase its length so considerably
as to secure space for converting it into a shell if necessary; and,
being able to use metal of any degree of hardness, he can adapt its
form and strength exactly to the work which it has to perform.
Thus with a rifle 39 inches long and half-inch bore, having a turn
in 20 inches, or two turns in its length, he finds no difficulty in
penetrating a wrought-iron plate 6-10ths of an inch thick or cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
a core out of a piece of solid timber half a foot thick; and some
idea may be formed of the extraordinary power of this arm when we
mention that his projectiles in their flight rotate at the rate of
15,000 revolutions per minute. The question of driving holes in
the 4-inch breast plates of floating batteries is at once solved by the
application of these principles to artillery, the construction of which
this new rifle proves must be completely revolutionized. A weapon
which in expert hands will make good practice at 1,400 yards, and
the range of which can be very easily helped by a telescope if
necessary, gives the <em class="ital">coup de grace</em> to our present system of field
batteries. At the Alma it would have silenced the Russian guns or
driven them from their position, rendering the rush of the Light
Division, with the heavy loss of life consequent thereon, unnecessary.
Nor during the siege of Sebastopol would the rope mantlets of the
Redan and the Malakhoff having given much protection to the men
working behind the embrasures,&#8221; &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>So much for the praise bestowed by Mr. Whitworth
on his own production. A beautiful experiment it
has been, and one for which the scientific world is
bound to be thankful; giving, as it does, perhaps a
faint idea only of what is yet to be effected.</p>

<p>However, all is not gold that glitters: it is very
well to do all this by straining every principle
that can be brought to bear,&mdash;extra charge, bullets
hardened and turned with mathematical precision,
steel barrels, with a fineness of polish in the interior
like that of a looking-glass&mdash;these are all great adjuncts
in the trial against an ordinary unprepared gun, taken
from a number promiscuously, and which perhaps might
be the worst specimen in the possession of the party
at Hythe. But these are trifles when compared with
the two following facts. The diameter of the bore
of Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s is 500, or half-inch at the largest
diameter, and 450 at the smallest, or a mean, taking
the two extremes, of fifty bore; the Enfield is 577, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
twenty-five bore, and the bullets on leaving the guns
were the same weight exactly. The length of the
Enfield bullet is <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch, that of the Whitworth is
1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch. But all this will be more fully seen from the
<a href="#Fig28">woodcuts</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">WHITWORTH BARREL AND BULLETS.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the amount of resistance
or displacement of atmospheric air by one bullet is
nearly double that of the other, and this is a most
important point in Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s favour; but the
quantity of gunpowder used in the one is precisely
the same as that used in the other, though Mr.
Whitworth&#8217;s rifle is little more than half the size of
bore, the pressure on the square inch being consequently
nearly double; hence the circumstances are
not sufficiently equal for Mr. Whitworth to claim for
his rifle any great superiority: the gun may take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
attention of the unwary, but its principles will not
bear investigation.</p>

<p>Let me change the circumstances of the case, by
retaining the principle of the Enfield, but changing the
bore to the same as Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s, increasing at
the same time the length of projectile, and I will
engage to beat it with a much reduced charge. The
extreme degree of female screw or spiral, one turn
in twenty inches, or two turns in the whole length
of the barrel, creates, as must be familiar to the
most obtuse mind, an enormous amount of friction,
and in consequence of this an equal quantity of
force is absorbed: in other words, there is a useless
waste of force.</p>

<p>The Enfield barrel has but a proportion of turn,
one in six feet six inches, or exactly half a spiral in
the three feet three, generating 300 per cent. less
friction than in the Whitworth rifle; so that on this
score alone the saving would be very great, and in
this trial the Whitworth would be inferior to the
Enfield; the inventor, therefore, has unjustly laid
claim to superiority, as the trial has been conducted
on very unequal terms.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitworth says his bullet rotates at the rate
of 15,000 revolutions in a minute; now the friction on
the periphery of a bullet having this extreme spinning
on an axis, must very much lessen its range. If we
weigh force, and carefully calculate its expenditure in
2,000 yards, the periphery has made 4,000 revolutions.
Now look at the shape of the hexagonal body
depicted in the <a href="#Fig29">woodcut</a> at page 377, and estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the friction it will undergo. The Enfield in the same
distance would rotate only 1,000 times, thus affording
another gain of 300 per cent. The question, therefore,
which arises is this: If all this can be done
equally well with the Enfield, why not do it? And
the answer is, because there is nothing to be gained
by it. Great doubts now exist whether the bore 25 is
not too great a reduction: in fact, you will find no
military advocates for it. The faculty will tell you
that small wounds are not so destructive as large
ones: the human body is as much affected by the
shock as by the penetration of a bullet. Many other
reasons might be advanced in favour of increased size
of bullet, and much more important reasons must be
given, before the whole military system has to be re-changed,
than a mere gain of 300 or 400 yards;
whilst there can be little doubt that the ranges we
now possess in the Enfield are more than equivalent
to our wants. The human eye cannot define precisely
at 900 or 1,000 yards, and yet greater accuracy is
required to fire a ball at a distance of 2,000 yards;
again, it is a question which has frequently arisen in
my mind, in how many situations in England or on
the Continent can we get a clear view of 2,000 yards.
The effort, indeed, to increase range appears like
seeking after a remedy for a disease which has never
yet been discovered.</p>

<p>If ranges of 2,000 yards and upwards are required,
rifled cannon will again take their proper place; for
on investigating the tables of practice published by
General Jacob, I find the average distance of shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
from the centre of butt to be, at 2,000 yards, nearly
9 feet, with 13&middot;7 degrees elevation; whilst the Whitworth
is said to be 11<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet, with about 8 degrees
of elevation. I saw, some time ago, some practice
at Shoeburyness with an 18-pounder rifle cannon,
which gave a range of 3,650 yards, with an elevation
of 0&middot;10<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> degrees, and a breeze blowing across, a mean
deflection of only 30 inches from the centre. This
throws Jacob, Whitworth, and the Enfield all into
the shade together; yet there can be no doubt that
this can be excelled, when heavier guns are brought
to the same state of perfection as this 18-pounder.
The case therefore stands thus: the Jacob rifle has a
greater range than the Enfield, at a cost of 100 per
cent. more friction, and an expenditure of 50 per cent.
more of projectile force; the Whitworth has also a
greater range, but at a cost of 300 per cent. more
friction, and 100 per cent. additional projectile force.
With these observations I leave this subject in the
hands of the public, being convinced that projectile
power obtained at such a cost will never come into
general use; though the production of the Whitworth
rifle will always be looked upon as an experiment of
very great interest.</p>

<p>There is but one other point relating to the use of
guns on such a principle, and that is their safety;
which is always of the greatest importance. It is a
well-known fact that the first movement of projectiles
depends very much on the amount of inertia in that
projectile; and different forms of projectiles, though of
the same weight, will offer very different amounts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
resistance to motion. No one can doubt that two
columns of lead, each of an ounce in weight, one being
as high again as the other, will offer different amounts
of resistance; first, from the law that the time occupied
in overcoming inertia is in proportion to the length
of that body; secondly, if these columns of metals
are confined in tubes, then the friction on the one
which is half an inch long will be much less than on
the other, which is one inch in length: and this is, on
the mildest terms, the relative position of the two.
There can be no doubt that a much greater pressure
is required to start the longer column of double the
length; but when we consider that there are the facets
of six angles, with a spiral inclination of one in nineteen,
the difficulty of starting this bullet becomes still
more apparent. Now suppose the gun has been loaded
a few hours, and a certain amount of adhesion has
been effected between the bullet and sides of the
barrel, by the unctuous deposit from previous discharges,
then the difficulty of starting the bullet
instantaneously will be still more increased: supposing
the breech end of a barrel, with the ordinary
charge of the Enfield cartridge and bullet, has a
force exerted upon it of 2,000 pounds in the square
inch, then in the hexagonal not much less than double
that strength will be requisite to meet the contingencies
of dirty guns: in fact I know that a serious
accident did occur very recently with a double rifle
constructed on Whitworth&#8217;s principle, notwithstanding
all the care bestowed upon it by a first-rate maker; and
I believe that this gun, if it is to be used with safety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
must have a barrel double the strength of other
rifles.</p>

<p>The doubtful nature of Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s experiments
must be apparent from the fact that they were
made in a shed, from which strong currents of air
were excluded: any bullet would range accurately in
vacuo, or in atmosphere equally quiescent; deductions,
therefore, drawn from such experiments must
be worthless. Battles occur not under such favourable
circumstances; protuberances on bullets tell most in
high currents, and least in a quiet atmosphere; so
that had the experiments been instituted in the open
air, they would doubtless have yielded a different
result. The hexagonal bullet of large size has been
proved to be very eccentric indeed in its flight; hence
a bullet of the smallest dimensions was used, for had
it been larger, its great enemy, the atmosphere, would
have rendered the chance of even partial success perfectly
hopeless.</p>

<p>Now, observe what would be the effect of extension
of length and decrease of diameter in the Greenerean
expansive bullet. Harden it by alloys, as adopted in the
Whitworth; use the same charge, and the probability
is great, that, from the absence of extreme friction,
it will excel in range, accuracy, and penetration the
Whitworth, as much as that does now the Enfield.</p>

<p>If the Government can see any important advantage
to be gained by extending the range we now possess;
if anything is to be gained by reduction from 25 to
50 bore; if, indeed, there is any point which is
advantageous in the Whitworth, I will pledge my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
reputation that this may be obtained in the expansive
principle: and that, too, with a much less expenditure
of expellant force.</p>

<p>The &#8220;hoodwinking&#8221; of the public by not disclosing
the fact that the pressure of the gunpowder in
the Whitworth was double, the bore being but one-half,
is at best an attempt at concealment not creditable
to the parties concerned. Knowledge of the
principles which regulate projectile science is not so
scanty as to allow the palm to be carried away from
the profession, and worn by a gentleman who, on his
own admission, is unpractised in the science of gunnery.
The science to be effectually improved must
be carried on at the cost of the nation, as Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s
experiments were. This fact certainly bears
the appearance of a good precedent, and I hope it
may be extended.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitworth, like General Jacob, has had to
sacrifice scientific economy in order to obtain the
points he required. I have already dilated upon the
truism that all projectiles range with the greatest
economy which have the centre of gravity in the head
or fore part of the bullet. I have also pointed out the
fact that the elongated projectiles which have not the
centre of gravity in the head, turn over during their
flight after leaving the muzzle of the gun; and this is
also found to be the case in rifles having a greater
degree of spiral than the Enfield, one turn in six feet
6 inches. To meet this difficulty, therefore, General
Jacob adopts one turn of spiral in every three feet:
thus his bullet in passing out has double the friction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
the Enfield; and when we look at the fact that he is
further compelled to increase the length of his bullet
to 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> diameters, a little reflection will point out the
entire want of economy in his whole arrangement.</p>

<p>On turning to the Whitworth, we find that, in order
to ensure his bullet keeping point foremost in its flight,
he has to double the very great spiral adopted by
Jacob: thus we have all its concomitant disadvantages,
friction, expenditure of matter, and danger of bursting
the gun. When we contemplate such arrangements
as exist in these two guns, it must be evident that
they are both self-destructive. No system of projectiles
can be durable which is effected by straining
all the acknowledged principles of mechanics; and
this has been done in each of these cases.</p>

<p>The scientific world knows well that a much higher
rate of speed can be attained in railway travelling
than is daily practised; but they also know that it
can only be obtained in the same way as Jacob and
Whitworth obtained their range in gunnery: namely,
by an excessive expenditure of fuel, and a wear of
engine amounting to comparative destruction; whilst,
at the same time, the danger is so much increased
that it would be folly and recklessness to persist in
such a course. The question, therefore, resolves itself
into this; that in locomotion and in projectile science,
if we would have them perfect, we must study the
mode of obtaining the greatest results with the least
expenditure of means.</p>

<p>Facility of loading must at all times be of great
importance: the soldier cannot have the means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
cleaning his rifle when in action, and yet if the
hexagonal principle were to be adopted, it must be
repeatedly cleaned, or it would be almost impossible
to load it, and when discharged it would either burst
or its fire would not be effective. During such a
war as that in India, going on day and night, a
soldier could not be expected to wash out his rifle
after every half-dozen shots.</p>

<p>The field in which experiments are carried on is
very different from that of a battle. Experiments, as
detailed, sometimes turn out most fallacious when put
to the use for which they are intended; and in no
case is this more apparent than in breech-loading
arms: thousands of rounds may be fired in a few
days with great success; but extend that over twelve
months, a certain number being fired every day, and
the gun being cleaned after each day&#8217;s practice, and
long before thousands are fired, the gun displays
weak points&mdash;points which could not be discovered
in the lesser experiment. So it is in practice: a gun
left dirty for hours is undergoing rapid destruction;
the unctuous deposit from gunpowder has such an
affinity for iron that minute galvanic cells are formed
on its surface in a very short time: half an hour
after a gun has been discharged in a damp atmosphere
these operations may be seen to be going on
with rapidity, and an old gun on the hexagonal principle
(if one should last long enough to grow old)
would not be a very desirable weapon, in point of
safety.</p>

<p>The comparative cost of ammunition for the hexagonal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
rifle and the Enfield, is a point of no little
importance. Calculation gives the former at something
equivalent to 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> or 5<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> at each discharge,
while the latter cannot exceed 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, or at most 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>&mdash;a
serious question for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>That this sum may be lessened by the employment
of machinery is not unlikely; but this can only be
done to a limited extent, it being essential that mathematical
nicety, as well as the right degree of hardness,
should be strictly observed, otherwise the power of
penetration will be sacrificed: and of this property
a great deal has been made. There are few who
do not know that a pound hammer will soon drive
to the head a fine-pointed slender nail; whilst a
short, thick, stumpy nail requires three times the
force: again, if fine steel polished nails were constructed,
a still smaller amount of force would suffice.
If such effects are carefully studied, much may be
done with very little means.</p>

<p>Very recently a statement appeared in the press
that, owing to some ill-made cartridges being served
out to the troops in India, the men found it almost
impossible to load their Enfield rifles at all; having
to call in the aid of trees and stones against which to
butt the ramrod, in order to force the bullet home.
The same account attributed this defect to the careless
construction of these cartridges by the contractors.
This, however, is unjust; all cartridges for the Enfield
rifles being alone produced in the laboratory at Woolwich;
and hence the defect is the more unpardonable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
It is easy to conceive that in India, where the heat
is intense, the grease on the cartridge might have
disappeared; the unctuous deposit of gunpowder on
the interior of the barrel is also rendered more
adhesive, and necessarily offers greater obstruction
to the ramming down of the bullet. The very slight
difference between the diameter of the bullet and
that of the bore, or windage, must necessarily add
to the difficulty under such circumstances; but if
half a size, or a few decimals of diameter, were
taken from the sides of the bullet and added to its
length, the difficulty would be effectually removed:
with increased length, and increasing means of expansion,
if necessary, such an occurrence could never
take place.</p>

<p>The original expanding bullet was intended to fill
up the difference of three sizes of gauge; surely,
then, there can be no difficulty in expanding a much
less diameter of bullet one half, or even full one
size of gauge. Where would be the difficulty in
having the bullet 26-bore, or even smaller, and expanding
it to 25. The occurrence, indeed, of such
a fact as that alluded to is to an intelligent mind
quite incomprehensible; it could only arise from
gross incompetency&mdash;some cobbling with the bullet&#8217;s
cup in the pressing, or perhaps enlargement by wear,
or more likely still from the pulp-made cartridge
paper. That this difficulty has been experienced is
obvious; and the inference is strong, that the official
managers of these affairs are still in the midst of
a long experiment: it is clear that they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
perfectly masters of the practice of gunnery, and it
is almost time the people of this country had their
work better done. It is more than probable that,
instead of meeting this difficulty with the proper
spirit of improvement, they will fly off at some other
tangent, and adopt the nostrum of some &#8220;arrant
quack;&#8221; thus effectually adding to the complication.</p>

<p>Each regiment ought to have moulds, and the
means of making their cartridges on such emergencies;
a body of provident officials ought to attend
to this, that a repetition of it may be avoided.</p>

<p>An ordinary mind would have perceived that, in
such lengthened operations as those our soldiers have
been engaged in, the cleaning of their arms would be
almost impossible; still the men are not instructed
that in such a difficulty an oiled rag passed up and
down the barrel would diminish it; neither is such a
simple remedy provided: let us trust, however, that
this misfortune will lead to improvement. If this
difficulty is encountered in the Enfield, which is,
comparatively speaking, a smooth bore, what would
be the difficulty in the hexagonal bore with two turns
in 39 inches! The possibility of loading the latter
would be very remote indeed, if not quite impracticable,
and a total bar to anything like its general
adoption.</p>

<p>Pure lead is indispensable for all rifle bullets, but
more especially for the expansive, which is in reality
useless without it. A lubricating grease, of a given
consistency for various climates, is also a desideratum
yet to be accomplished; how desirable it would be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
is shown by all the accounts of good shooting I have
ever received or met with.</p>

<p>A vast number of projectiles have been produced,
and strenuously advocated; but from the total want
of scientific arrangement in their construction they
have had but a very short existence. The vital
principle in all elongated projectiles is to have the
centre of gravity in the fore end; wanting that, an
unnecessary spinning motion must be resorted to, at
the cost of immense friction: for the tendency to
change position can only be obviated by excessive
spiral motion; whilst in a bullet having the centre
of gravity in the head, much less spiral motion
suffices: its scientific construction admits of no tendency
to change; straight forward is its natural
inclination, and to this inclination it adheres.</p>

<p>A late writer on projectiles has laboured hard to
condemn the expansive principle and the cup; he
has even aspired to lecture on it before Royalty, and
as an improvement upon it, he recommends the following
invention of his own:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;In my endeavours to remedy the evils which have
been so often and justly complained of, I attempted
the construction of several bullets, particularly with
the view of solving the question&mdash;can a cylindro-conoidal
bullet be contrived, which will have a flat
surface for its base, and the centre of gravity in the
fore part? In my attempts from time to time I met
with less or more success until I arrived at my last
improvement, the principle of which has afforded me
so much satisfaction, that I fancy I have only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
describe it, to enable any intelligent marksman to
perceive at once the utility of the contrivance.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the end of the bullet, which is a fair cylinder
for half its length, I formed a cavity of a conical
form, similar to the inside of a small thimble, which
stretches forward somewhat more than half the length
of the bullet, and which is wide enough to reduce
sufficiently the weight of the hinder end, so as to
throw the centre of gravity into the fore part, even
after the explosion of the charge takes place. On the
edge of the cavity I made an indentation, or shoulder,
about a twelfth of an inch in depth, and upon this I
placed an iron disc of the same thickness, which closes
up the cavity even with the end of the bullet, making a
flat surface of that part; so that it may be called a hollow
flat-ended bullet, though to all appearance solid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The adoption of the disc, and the closing of the
orifice at the bottom of the bullet, is merely the production
of an elongated plug with weak sides, which
must necessarily be driven in upon themselves, and
thus shortened; and in so doing they expand. The
disc prevents the possibility of the explosive gases
acting upon the centre of gravity or the head, and
thus the advantage of that being the primary motion
is lost; and which ensures the absence of &#8220;wobbling,&#8221;
a principle inherent in all plug bullets after leaving
the muzzle: and a defect which it was the main
object of my invention to avoid. The idea is evidently
that of Captain Norton, as evinced in his rifle shell,
and consequently is a plagiarism, either deliberate or
accidental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig30" id="Fig30"></a>

<p class="caption">SWISS BULLET.</p>
</div>

<p>The <a href="#Fig30">Swiss bullet</a> has obtained to some extent a reputation,
admitting, like the Lancaster elliptical bullet,
of being put into higher velocity. Its range, however,
is limited, from the very great friction it undergoes
in passing up the barrel: it is driven in upon itself
until it becomes a mere plug of lead with a hemispherical
head; and the centre of gravity being
behind, ensures its flight frequently terminating by
turning &#8220;topsy turvy.&#8221; Moreover, it cannot be used
on a large scale, except by the addition of a hard
metal point, as in General Jacob&#8217;s bullet.</p>

<p>The wisdom displayed in rifling barrels with the
gathering or deepening groove may be doubted; it
admits of serious consideration, whether or not it
tends to increase the friction of the bullet passing
outward. It is evident that did the bullet expand
all at once it would do so; but as this is well known
not to be the case, the question arises what is the
advantage gained? for it is asserted on high authority
that it improves the shooting. The mere deepening
of the grooves at the breech end can have but
little effect; and the question is, does the shallowing
of the grooves as the bullet approaches the muzzle,
produce the effect? We think it does. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
process of rifling these barrels, the rifling tool, by a
very ingenious arrangement of screws, is caused
gradually to cut deeper as it travels from the muzzle
to the breech, so that when finished the depth of
grooves at the muzzle is &middot;005 of an inch; half-way
down the barrel it is &middot;010, and at the breech end
&middot;015: thus gradually deepening <sup>10</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub> of an inch,
whereas the usual method of rifling is to have one
uniform depth of &middot;010 inches. From the contraction
of the protuberances on the bullet from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5000</sub> of
an inch in passing up the barrel, results the apparent
benefit: such a reduction would surely allow of the
bullet continuing its flight with less friction on the
atmosphere; for it cannot be too often repeated that
perfect smoothness, even to a polished surface, is
essential to the easy passage of all bullets through
the air.</p>

<p>There are some rather curious deductions obtained
by practice alone, which to ordinary minds appear
of trifling importance; but they clearly show that
correct rifle-shooting can only be obtained by the
most perfect arrangement in the rifling and scientific
construction of the barrels.</p>

<p>The Government have lately adopted a highly
finished and costly rifle arm, with sword bayonet
attached to the usual form of bar soldered to the
end of the barrels on the right side. When these
barrels were first constructed, they were made lighter
than experience subsequently showed they ought to
be; for it was found that the barrel not expanding
equally with the other portions at this necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
rigid point, influenced the shooting of the gun to a
considerable extent; so that an increase of metal was
found necessary.</p>

<p>The difficulty of obtaining good shooting with
double rifles, one side of each barrel being held rigid
whilst the other is yielding, explains the difficulty,
and points to the remedy: an increase of metal, or,
what would be more convenient, the adoption of the
most perfect laminated steel for all double rifles; it
being self-evident that soft barrels and correct rifle-shooting
are to a certain extent incompatible.</p>

<p>Double rifles have nearly superseded single ones;
for few who can afford the additional price will use
the latter, when in the same weight he can have two
useful weapons. The one great end generally sought
in a rifle is sufficient weight to neutralise the force
of the explosion or recoil; and the additional barrel
answers this as effectually as additional thickness of
iron in the single. But there is one objection which
I have never been able to master in the construction
of double rifle barrels, and I much doubt the
possibility of effectually overcoming it&mdash;another proof
that mathematical demonstrations are frequently wrong
in practice, however correct in theory. Many hold
it to be essential that double rifle barrels should
be put together perfectly parallel. I followed this
rule, and was at considerable cost in perfecting tools
for the purpose; yet, strange to say, in trial I found
invariably that the right barrel threw the ball slightly
to the right, and the left to the left. This I have
been at enormous trouble to ascertain, and am enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
positively to declare it is an indisputable fact. The
cause of it is evidently the recoil not striking the stock
in the centre, but on one side; which causes the gun
to swerve to that side. However small or unapparent
the recoil may be, still there is a recoil; and hence its
effect. To remedy this it is necessary to incline the
barrels in, towards the muzzle, to counteract that
tendency; but in doing this another evil is created,
for you can only do this to suit a given distance,
either 100, 150, or 200 yards, as may be determined.
Thus it will be perceived a deficiency must exist at
all times; and it shows clearly the necessity for motion
being resisted centrically, if truth is to be maintained.
This defect in the double rifle will always be a drawback
to the &#8220;<em class="ital">most correct</em> shooting;&#8221; yet under ordinary
circumstances it may not be a matter of vital
importance, neither does there exist any means of
sighting to overcome the difficulty. The only way
to obtain a double rifle perfectly true&mdash;perfectly
parallel, is to construct the barrels one above the
other, as double pistols are now constructed. The
only objection to them is the difficulty attending the
arrangement of the locks, as one cock must strike
the nipple the thickness of the barrel below the
other, and is an unsightly matter at best. These
facts lead to another, namely, the necessity of all
rifles being stocked as straight as possible, avoiding
in all cases any casting off in the butt; as it is evident
that these matters have considerable influence on the
correctness of shooting.</p>

<p>One great drawback to correct shooting is produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
from the stock being thrown off at the butt end;
and, in other cases, from imperfections in the stocking
of the gun&mdash;all truth depending on the barrel or
barrels being both stocked and held perfectly level
in the act of using. It must be quite clear, that
in case the right barrel of a pair be depressed but
the 32nd part of an inch, the angle of the sight
on the top, instead of giving elevation, will cause
the line of flight of ball to be to the left, and &#8220;<em class="ital">vice
vers&acirc;</em>.&#8221; Therefore, first of all be sure the gun is
held square; and great advantage will be found in
pointing the muzzle in all cases a few feet below
the object, and raising it in a perfect line upwards to
the bull&#8217;s eye. If this can be done well, in addition
to the gun being held square, the better half of
the difficulty is overcome; further practice will make
perfect.</p>

<p>The point next in importance, is to take off the
weight of the pull in the trigger, during the upward
motion; overcoming the last atom of weight
as the muzzle sight covers the bull&#8217;s eye. It must
be done so gradually, that no jerk or pull can move
the gun, be it ever so triflingly: in fact, all good
shots fire thus while the gun is in motion. If the
sight cannot be correctly obtained during the movement,
always take the rifle down from the shoulder,
and raise it again; for depend upon it, rifle shooting
can never be acquired perfectly, where the habit
is practised of holding the gun at the shoulder,
&#8220;poking&#8221; the muzzle about and seeking the bull&#8217;s eye.
All good shooting is produced from the shoulder;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
an absence of pulsation in the body which is induced
by holding a weight. The shoulder rests are
found to be the cause of vibration; resting one part
of the body and straining another begets it instantly,
and where rests are used they should be merely supports
for the muzzle, and not for the centre of the
gun. If the centre is placed upon it, the action of
recoil is almost sure to jump the gun upwards. The
best shooting can be accomplished from the shoulder,
if the above instructions be carefully followed. Avoid
in all cases gripping a rifle tightly, or you will most
assuredly communicate the pulsation of the body to
the rifle.</p>

<p>During the Crimean war many of the Enfield rifles
expanded so much with the Pritchett plug bullet as
not only to loosen all the bands on the stock, but
also to produce a visible effect on the barrel; and to
remedy this the Government adopted my expanding
screw bands, which admit of being tightened by the
screw when necessary.</p>

<p>The production of a perfect breech-loading small
arm is as difficult as the production of a perfect
breech-loading cannon, and that is so problematical as
to amount, in my humble opinion, to nearly an impossibility.
All experience teaches that a perfectly sound
base of projection in the gun is indispensable, if good
direction and velocity are required; without which
there can be no good shooting. If this be a law, how
can it be obtained where soundness is absent? Joints,
slides, and their attendants, are all incompatible with
soundness: the two cannot exist together; and hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
no breech-loader can give the same results as a solid
constructed gun barrel, unsoundness and absorption
of power being always found to go hand in hand
together.</p>

<p>I have had considerable experience in breech-loading
guns, having obtained one or two patents; and
very careful attention to the subject has satisfied me
that the question was sufficiently ventilated soon after
the adoption of gunnery, and that it was exhausted by
many hundreds of inventors as ingenious as those of
the present day; the result being in all cases a total
failure.</p>

<p>One of the best breech-loading carbines of the
present day is undoubtedly that of Mr. F. W.
Prince, and those to whom they are unobjectionable
will certainly find in this the simplest and a
most effective weapon of the kind: Mr. Prince
has certainly made the most of the practical knowledge
he has brought to bear upon the invention.</p>

<p>Revolving rifles are, like revolving pistols, complicated
weapons, useful only for certain purposes;
requiring, as they do, very great care and cleanliness,
to insure at best their limited services. Long barrels
are useless, because all the velocity that can be given
to the projectile has to be generated in the revolving
chambers; all the superfluous force escaping at the
joint of breeches and barrels. For any useful purpose,
a nine-inch would be better than a longer barrel,
allowing the bullet to leave the muzzle at a much
higher velocity than it would do after passing through
a barrel of thirty inches. It is evident, indeed, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
a revolving pistol and a revolving rifle are possessed
of power in inverse ratio to their lengths.</p>

<p>The French Government are making great efforts
to improve their military system, in imparting to
every soldier as much information relative to his
weapons and the best method of using them, as is
compatible with his limited education. Their institution
of a normal-school for the instruction of the
whole army in all that relates to guns, shooting, and
natural &#8220;trigonometry,&#8221; is proof of this. A detachment
from every infantry regiment in the service
arrives at &#8220;Vincennes&#8221; early in the spring, and
the men undergo a complete course of instruction
during the whole of the summer and autumn months,
or until by ability they acquire all that is to be taught.
The first and a very essential part of the duty is to
teach them to judge of distance; for this purpose a
soldier takes a target, and runs straight ahead as far
as he pleases. Having planted it, each man is called
upon to judge the distance, which is recorded in a
report of the day. This exercise is carried on
to a great extent, until each becomes well able to
judge correctly; then commences the instruction in
shooting, each soldier using an elevation according
to the distance he calculates he is from the target;
and this is practised at all distances, from 500 to
1,000 paces. The greatest degree of perfection
attained by the instructed is rewarded, by promotion
or otherwise; and such skill in shooting is displayed
by these various detachments as would truly astonish
our military officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>The accomplishment of a school of instruction for
teachers of rifle shooting to the British army is now
an established fact; the results, most flattering to
the projectors, more than verifying their anticipations.
The degree of perfection attained by some
before leaving Hythe is so extraordinary, that I will
leave the reality to be imagined or witnessed; and it
will well repay the journey. The standing order
lately issued, awarding substantial benefits to the
adept in shooting, is sure to bear its fruits, and is
only the first step to many others of no less importance.</p>

<p>Double rifled carbines can be constructed of so
light a weight that their exclusive use for cavalry
purposes is not far distant, 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> pounds being sufficient
weight to ensure perfect safety. A carbine of this
description, from 18 to 20 inches in the barrel, could
give a practical range of from 600 to 700 yards, with
an extreme range of 1,000 to 1,100. A cavalry
soldier armed with two of these would be equal to
four of the present day, for they would be no greater
encumbrance than the late carbine used by the
Guards, which approaches 10 lbs. in weight; and a
pair of double carbines could easily be carried at the
saddle bow, their length being no obstacle.</p>

<p>Revolvers have not yet been, and I fear they never
can be, made sufficiently durable to become a useful
cavalry appendage. The fact may be concealed, but
it is true, nevertheless, that their fragile nature,
independently of their great cost, will always confine
their use to an exclusive few: indeed, revolving and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
breech-loading weapons are among the doubtful class
of arms, not fully developed as yet, even if they ever
can be.</p>

<p>The adoption of double carbines will eventually
throw all other small arms for cavalry purposes into
the back ground; a range of 1,000 yards with a toy
5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lbs. in weight is one of the greatest wonders of this
wonderful age, showing the astonishing change which
has been effected in gunnery: for a deadly power now
exists in the most Lilliputian toy as well as in the
Brobdignagian monster; and that, too, at immense
distances. In proof of this, I will just quote a letter
from that gallant officer, Lieutenant William A.
Kerr, Southern Mahratta Irregular Horse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right padr3">&#8220;<i>Camp, Bejapore, May 29th, 1858.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;I have received the Enfield carbine, and am much pleased
with it in every respect. It cannot, I consider, be improved on,
and is by far the best weapon for the mounted service I have ever
handled. It is but due to you that I should mention, that your
work, as put into the carbine, is far beyond what I expected at the
money. I hope to be in a position, at no very distant date, to give
you a heavy commission, and will certainly recommend you in
every way I can. I have knocked over a deer at 400 yards with
the carbine, and make very good practice up to 800 yards, by firing
with two drachms of fine rifle powder. I have given it, and Prince&#8217;s
breech-loader, a fair trial; the latter cannot be compared to the
former; it has not the same range, power of projection, or of shooting;
it moreover fouls in the proportion of at least 3 to 1 more.
Had I had such carbines at Kolapore, I would have destroyed the
27th Native Infantry in an hour.</p>

<p>The weight of this single carbine is only 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> lbs., and
it is 20 inches in the barrel. The great power of shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
would justify a reduction of length
to 15 inches, thus reducing the
weight to a little over 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> lbs.; and
yet this carbine would be more
certain in its effects at 600 yards,
than old Brown Bess at 150. The
complaint that carbines are found
to be an encumbrance in the service
is no longer valid: they may be
made to form merely a portion of
the saddle with the same facility of
handling as a pistol, and with a hundredfold
greater accuracy of range.</p>

</div>

<p>The hybrid affair, adopted by the
Government, of a pistol made to
serve as a carbine by the introduction
of a loose butt, is of doubtful
utility: if valuable as a carbine, it
will never be used as a pistol; hence
it had been much better to make
it a carbine at once, thus rendering
it at the same time more durable
and less costly: even a double
carbine might be constructed at
about twice the price paid for the
socket joint alone. But there is
still a want in the Government
establishment of &#8220;designers&#8221; of
ability; all that has been effected
by way of improvement has been
done by feeling the way: a kind of progressional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
experiment, with a total absence of mind to grasp
good ideas, and to hold them fast. The arms used
by the corps of Guides who have distinguished themselves
so much in India are now seven years old, and
they will bear comparison with the best arms our
Government are only just now producing: in fact,
the irregular cavalry in India have always been armed
with weapons in advance of those of the Government
troops; and the explanation of this is very suggestive,
they provide arms for themselves, and are more alive
than the Government officials to the importance of
having good ones.</p>

<p>The adoption of greased cartridges in India by
some irregular corps, took place in carbines supplied
by me eight or nine years ago; and the origin of
the idea was this:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The principal objection urged against the adoption
of the rifle, is that of loading. I know not
how quickly it is possible to load a musket; but
with cartridges properly made, I think I could load
and fire a rifle four times in a minute. But then
it will be said, at the conclusion of so many shots,
the rifle gets so foul, that it will be difficult to get
the ball down. Not difficult at all. Have your
cartridges made with a saturated cover, to surround
the ball, and fit properly the grooves of the rifle.</p>

<p>It would clean the barrel so much, as to allow
forty shots to be fired with as much ease as you now
fire twenty. Or let a steel-wire brush be attached
to the rifle; and by screwing it to the end of the rod,
you can, by two or three times rubbing up and down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
remove any accumulation of dirt from the powder.
If, however, the covering I have mentioned were
used with a weighty rod to the rifle, there would be
no occasion for cleaning, short of fifty shots.</p>

<p>Experience leaves no room for doubt that a few
grooves are better than many, in all expansive-principled
rifles: the nearer the approach to a smooth
surface the better, and the three divisions of grooves
and projections adopted by the British Government
is the best to meet all requirements. They will shoot
as well as poly-grooved rifles; and if three grooves
give the same result, more are unnecessary and useless.
The advantage of the atmosphere acting to keep
the bullet steady by its current down the grooving
on the bullet seems to meet with no confirmation; improved
shooting accruing by the grooves being reduced,
as in the case of the gathering-grooved rifle experiments.
In all cases of wild animal shooting at short
distances with small charges, the many grooves will
be an advantage: the same as those formerly adopted,
and which are shown in the <a href="#Fig32">cut</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig32" id="Fig32"></a>
<img src="images/illo428.jpg" alt="Poly-groove rifle" width="200" height="196" />
</div>

<p>Expansive bullets may be effectually used; but in
varying charges, incidental to game shooting, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
form of cavity in the bullet as is observed in the
Enfield would not act, therefore a large cavity would
be preferable to enable the less charge to act in
expanding the lead into the grooving.</p>

<p>For other purposes than war, rifles will continue to
be constructed on the poly-groove principle, and with
spherical bullets. The perfect destruction of various
animals is dependent generally on two causes: the
penetration into the body, and the shock to the
system during that act of penetration. No doubt
exists that a spherical bullet would combine these two
qualities best. The 25 bore, the 32 and 50 hexagonal
bore would be, practically speaking, useless for
the killing of elephants, tigers, &amp;c. The effectual
and instant killing of seals on ice is an illustration:
failing to kill a seal dead, he will to a certainty reach
his hole in the ice, and disappear, to the shooter&#8217;s
serious disappointment. Small bore elongated bullets
were very rapidly adopted, and as rapidly abandoned.
&#8220;They did not kill dead;&#8221; the spherical bullet did
this better. It would be wise to pause and consider
whether a good military rifle is a good game-shooting
rifle or not: whether the hole in the beast be wide
enough. I am inclined to think the reduction to
a bore of 25 too small for this purpose. In military
muskets of smooth bore, the elongated bullet is
not applicable: very little benefit is gained in using
them in a smooth bore; and, although the original
invention contemplated this, experience decided otherwise.
The spherical bullet being thus indispensable,
it follows that one size should be adopted which combines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the greatest number of favourable points. Many
years ago I made numberless experiments to ascertain
this fact, and had it demonstrated beyond all doubt
to be a bore of 18 and a bullet of 19; the difference
in size admitting of the paper of the cartridge with a
moderate degree of tightness. The ultimate range
of such a musket with three drachms of gunpowder,
would be equal to the range of the Enfield; but, of
course, without one-tenth its accuracy. Yet for close
quarters, line-firing, or quickness of loading, the
musket will hold its place for centuries to come;
and that this opinion is entertained by many officers,
is proved by the fact that our Government is at this
moment issuing contracts for 100,000 plain-bored
muskets: 17 bore, 3 feet 3 inches long in the barrel.
The near approximation of bore to my standard is
suggestive of the influence my writings have had
after many years, as the following extract from my
book of 1842 shows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Military rifles should never be shorter than three
feet&mdash;say three feet three inches, with half-turn of
spiral&mdash;the length of the musket. They should not
be larger in the bore than a ball eighteen to the
pound, as at that length a force, calculated to throw
an extreme distance, might be generated. Whatever
may be the arguments for heavy substances, they do
not avail here, as it is impossible to throw them either
with velocity or accuracy; for there never can be
certainty, where so much elevation is required. The
size of ball we have mentioned, can be thrown with
great certainty, as far, if not farther, than any soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
in her Majesty&#8217;s service can accurately survey a single
object. For the purpose of annoying a dense body
of men, such as a square column, such a rifle would
be an invaluable gun; as the muskets now made will
not throw a ball one-half the distance. As to the
actual range of a rifle of this bore and length, I
should think it would reach, effectively, the distance
of 1,500 yards.&#8221;</p>

<p>The experimental or competitive trials by the
Royal Engineers at Chatham to prove the superiority
of the elliptical bored rifle over the Enfield, is another
of those occasional clap-traps with which the public
are amused. The ordinary reader would judge and
set it down for an established fact that the elliptical
rifle was, as has generally been represented,
an invention purely Lancasterian, gun and bullet;
while the real facts are quite contrary: true, the
barrel is rifled, slightly elliptical, and having &#8220;an
increasing spiral;&#8221; but the ammunition is that of
the Enfield&mdash;the &#8220;&#8216;Greenerian&#8217; expansive bullet
with the centre of gravity in the head.&#8221; The
bullet that Lancaster adopted, as well known, had
a leaden plug. I quote from the report of the select
committee:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The plug bullet used by Mr. Lancaster does not appear
suitable for military service, for when the plug is driven into the
bullet by the ignition of the powder, it generally nips the paper of
the cartridge between itself and the base of the bullet, and carries a
portion of it away, as may be seen by the specimens sent to the
committee; upon the amount of paper so carried away by the ball
depends the accuracy or inaccuracy of its flight; and the plugs do
not in all cases remain firmly attached to the bullet.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>What then are these trials conducted to prove? It
cannot be the superiority of Lancaster&#8217;s bullet; for he
has abandoned that, &#8220;<em class="ital">and uses the Enfield</em>.&#8221; Is it the
rifling?&mdash;if so, let us see what the same committee
say of that:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The chief peculiarity of this rifle consists in the inner surface of
the barrel being smooth, instead of cut into grooves, as in most rifled
barrels. As a substitute for grooves, the interior of the barrel is cut
into the form of an ellipse, whose major axis exceeds the minor by
&middot;005 of an inch. The ball is rifled by being forced (when expanded
by the explosion of the gunpowder) into the major axis of the
ellipse, which thus fulfils the office of grooves in conducting the ball
into the required degree of spiral motion.</p>

<p>&#8220;As Mr. Lancaster has adopted the American plan of a &#8216;gaining-twist,&#8217;
or &#8216;increasing spiral,&#8217; and applied it to his smooth-bored
barrels with <em class="ital">elongated</em> projectiles, it may be as well to consider the
merits of this system.</p>

<p>&#8220;The advantages are supposed to be:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">

<li>&#8220;1st. Increased accuracy.</li>

<li>&#8220;2nd. Less recoil.</li>

<li>&#8220;3rd. An absence of the tendency a ball has, when starting
with a rapid spiral, to twist the rifle over sideways to the
right or left, according to the inclination of the grooves.</li>

<li>&#8220;4th. A diminution of the tendency a ball has to &#8216;strip&#8217;
when first started.</li>

</ul>

<p>&#8220;1st. The alleged increased accuracy has been by some attributed
to the supposition that the revolutions of the bullet round its
own axis increase in rapidity while passing through the air, in
consequence of having acquired that motion when passing through
the barrel, under the influence of the grooves; but it is difficult to
imagine how a leaden bullet can carry within itself, after leaving
the muzzle, any power of increasing its own rotatory or progressive
motion.</p>

<p>&#8220;2nd. That there should be less recoil is natural, as the bullet
meets with less opposition when first started from a state of rest;
but the amount of recoil in all rifles now made for expanding
projectiles is quite inconsiderable, and not worth noticing.</p>

<p>&#8220;3rd. The tendency of a bullet to twist the rifle on one side is
now avoided by reducing the spirality of the grooves. Instead of<span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
being one turn in three or four feet as formerly, it is now one turn
in six feet six inches, and sometimes only one turn in eight or nine
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;4th. The advocates of this system maintain that a bullet is less
likely to &#8216;strip,&#8217; or pass out of the barrel without rifling itself,
when conducted gradually into the required degree of spirality.
But the question is, whether in a well-constructed rifle, the bullet
<em class="ital">does</em> strip? and if not, then a gaining-twist is unnecessary and
objectionable, as it offers to the ball&#8217;s progress a continually increasing
opposition, while the ball itself is subjected to a continually
increasing urging force from the inflamed gunpowder in the barrel,
so that, as the velocity of the ball increases, so also does the
resistance to its escape. A projectile is set in motion gradually,
and is (or should be, if the quality and quantity of the powder, and
the barrel, have a right proportion to each other) at its greatest
velocity just before leaving the muzzle; consequently the tendency
of a ball would be to yield to the increasing force of the powder and
pass straight out of the barrel without following the grooves; and
this more especially in a smooth bore, which has no clearly defined
edges to hold and guide the ball to its proper degree of spirality,
but where the lead may be compressed along the smooth surface so
as to pass straight along the barrel.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>So much for the gaining twist; it requires no
further argument. The oval bore is not an invention
of Mr. Lancaster: it is older than Captain Beaufoy&#8217;s
book, &#8220;Scloppetaria,&#8221; published in 1808, for in it
you will find a description how to rifle a smooth
bore; and he gives drawings of the tools to do it
with.</p>

<p>If these statements are facts&mdash;and I defy them
being gainsaid&mdash;what connection has this gentleman
with it at all? for what purpose is it pompously
announced that the Lancaster elliptical bored rifle
shoots superior to the Enfield, when there is <em class="ital">not such
a thing</em>? The superior shooting of one man over
another is more than sufficient explanation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
highly unscientific theory of putting a bullet into
excessive spiral motion at the instant it has acquired
a maximum of velocity is untenable, admitting of no
lucid explanation. The Enfield rifle has evidently
many enemies, who do not hesitate in injuring her
reputation, nor hesitate about the means of doing it.
All elliptical bores are but the two-grooved rifle in
disguise: an idea fast exploding.</p>

<p>The truth of my opinion about the two-grooved
or Brunswick rifle, introduced into the service in
1840, is now proved. Many of my readers will
recollect that in my books of 1842 and 1846 I
termed this &#8220;an abortion of science:&#8221; it has since
died with that cognomen; though it was puffed
up, as my readers will remember, by many high
authorities, and amongst the rest by Dr. Ure, who
said nearly as much for it as is now advanced in
favour of the hexagonal rifle. On referring to the
report of the Select Committee on Small Arms,
published in 1852, I find the following account
of it:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;At all distances above 400 yards the shooting was
so wild as to be unrecorded. The Brunswick rifle
has shown itself to be much inferior in point of range
to every other arm hitherto noticed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The loading of this rifle is so difficult that it is
wonderful how the rifle regiments have continued to
use it so long&mdash;the force required to ram down the
ball being so great as to render any man&#8217;s hand
unsteady for accurate shooting. Comment is unnecessary.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prussian needle gun, too, has departed this
life: another instance of the absurdity of adopting
plans containing in themselves the reverse of scientific
principles; for it may safely be accepted as an axiom
that success at the present day can only arise to
mechanical constructions which are based on those
immutable foundations of mechanical science in
accordance with great Nature&#8217;s laws.</p>

<p>That the principles of the expansive or &#8220;Greenerian&#8221;
rifles are fast gaining the approbation of all
scientific men qualified by their pursuits to judge, is
evident from the fact that Birmingham has contributed,
within the last twelve months, a considerable
number of workmen to construct Enfield rifles in all
the principal States of Europe. France, and Russia
especially, are expending large amounts in manufacturing
this arm; so that it is no stretch of
imagination to suppose that in a few years the
equilibrium of arms will be again established, all
nations being armed with equally good weapons,
to contrast with the contemptible ones of bygone
times.</p>

<p>Before separating for the recess, a question was
asked from the officials by an honourable member
in the House of Commons:&mdash;&#8220;When a report would
be given in as to the relative merits of the Enfield
and Whitworth rifles as military weapons?&#8221; The
answer given was evidently intended to mystify; for,
from the most intimate inquiries I have made, I
find that no experiments whatever are in progress.
The last took place at Woolwich, in October, 1857,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
and terminated so very unsatisfactorily, that Mr.
Whitworth wished to make some alterations in his
rifles, in order to overcome the difficulties presented.
Up to the present time the authorities inform me
that no other rifles have been sent in for further
trial.</p>

<p>The defects demonstrated in these experiments
were precisely those pointed out in this chapter.
On reversing their positions, &#8220;hard bullets <em class="ital">v.</em> soft,&#8221;
the penetration of the Enfield was found to be equal
to that of the Whitworth; the same number of elm
deals being perforated. This proves what may be
done by &#8220;mechanical dodges,&#8221; and how intimately
acquainted those in charge of &#8220;gunnery experiments&#8221;
ought to be with all its ramifications, or they, too,
may be hoodwinked.</p>

<p>The difficulty of loading was here more strongly
exemplified than at Hythe. The deposit from the
&#8220;Government gunpowder&#8221; became so tenacious in
the &#8220;hexagonal grooves,&#8221; that after a certain number
of shots, loading became a very difficult matter
indeed; so much so, that Mr. Whitworth considerately
provided a very superior description of
gunpowder, with which the hexagonal rifle worked
a little better. The recoil, too, was of that severe
kind as to leave strong recollections of its force on
the minds of the reluctant operative shooters employed
to carry out the experiment. The entire
result may be summed up, in the mildest term, as
&#8220;unsatisfactory.&#8221; The concealment of this result
may be probably a considerate act on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
the late Government; the parts acted by some of
the members of it must be strong in the recollection
of others; and letting <em class="ital">down quietly</em> this very highly
inflated &#8220;wind-bag,&#8221; when it showed symptoms of
collapse, was doubtless a judicious act.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="chapname">REVOLVING PISTOLS.</span></h2>

<p>Revolving or repeating pistols have now become as
necessary in war as the rifle. The peculiarity of the
contests in various parts of America first showed the
necessity of a weapon being constructed, the moral
and destructive effects of which should be equal.</p>

<p>Colonel Colt was unquestionably the first to overcome
the difficulties found to exist in the earliest
productions, and when the introduction of the revolver
into Europe became general, and the demands for it
increased, the manufacturers were enabled, from the
commencement, to avoid the defects which he had
overcome in the course of his experience; and thus,
their task was a lighter one than his. An immense
number of revolving pistols have been constructed in
a very short time; but, like all new creations in
mechanical science, the production has been distinguished
by quantity rather than quality. The general
adoption of these arms has been greatly impeded by
the very inferior quality produced. Revolving pistols
may be had from 10<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr> upwards; but as to the utility
of such cheap trash nothing can be said. The possession
of one may have a moral effect on the courage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
the bearer, and its appearance may act on the fears of
the opponent, but the danger is greatest to him who
fires. The complicated arrangement of all repeating
fire-arms requires that they should be of the very best
workmanship, if they are to be safe and efficient
weapons. That they have been of the utmost use to
the allied armies in the Crimea, and in that more
desultory but treacherous struggle in the East, is
certain. Many and valuable lives have been saved by
their ready application. The moral effect of the revolver
was amply demonstrated where one noble young
soldier held his post at &#8220;Rewah&#8221; by the dread of
his revolver alone; the mutineers knowing well that
six of them must fall before they could reach him,
and feeling that each might be one of the six, he held
his own until relief came.</p>

<p>Again, a tale is told of another gallant officer who
shot five in succession, reserving the sixth for that
arch-miscreant Nana Sahib; but unfortunately that
sixth barrel missed fire. How many thousands of
lives that shot might have saved had it been successfully
fired! With all good, however, comes a certain
amount of evil: no perfect weapon has ever yet been
constructed; but this shows how desirable it is that a
perfect revolver should be invented, if possible.</p>

<p>There are but few manufacturers of revolvers who
have reached any degree of eminence: Colt, Dean,
Adams, Tranter, and Webley, comprise nearly all the
distinguished men in this country. There are a multitude
of second-rate makers in England, France, and
Belgium; but the most celebrated makers in Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
are those I have enumerated; and in order to guide
the reader as far as my knowledge will serve, I will
impartially point out the advantages and defects
belonging to each production.</p>

<p>The construction of Colonel Colt&#8217;s repeating pistol
is, according to his own description, a motion got
by cocking the lock and rotating the cylinders; as
described in the following quotation:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;They differ from those formerly made, principally in the
greater simplicity and the better proportions of the parts of the
lock and the framework. Important additions and improvements
have been made in the loading lever and rammer for forcing the
balls firmly into the cylinder, the employment of the helical or
spiral groove on the arbor on which the cylinder turns, whose sharp
edges are intended to prevent fouling by scraping off any smoke or
dirt accumulating in the cylinder from the lateral fire entering the
centre opening, and the inclined plane leading to the recesses on
the periphery of the cylinder, to direct the bolt below the opposite
shoulder in the recesses; thus preventing the cylinder from being
accidentally thrown too far by the sudden action of cocking. The
lock is now composed of five working parts, instead of seventeen, as
formerly; and it is obvious that if the several parts of the machinery
are made proportionally strong for the work they have to do, so is
the arm rendered more efficient by the greater simplicity of the
general construction.</p>

<p>&#8220;In all arms having a moveable breech it is desirable to
bring the barrel and cylinder as nearly in contact as possible, in
order to prevent the escape of lateral fire, and yet to leave freedom
for motion, without friction: this is now effected by the base pin,
on which the cylinder turns, entering a corresponding opening in
the under part of the barrel, being there held in place by a key
passing through and bearing against the back end of the slot in the
barrel, and the fore end of the slot in the base pin, which is thus
drawn up to the bottom of the hole, and yet the barrel is prevented
from being brought too close upon, or in absolute contact with, the
cylinder, whilst its end is still held in its proper position with
respect to the cylinder. In the event of any abrasion of the end of
the cylinder or of the barrel, by deepening the cavity, or filing the<span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
end of the base pin, the key can be driven further in, and the
proper distance for the readjustment of those parts be maintained,
whilst the essential rigidity of structure is secured.</p>

<p>&#8220;In loading the present arm, it is necessary to draw back the
hammer to the half notch, to allow the cylinder to be rotated freely
by hand; a charge of powder is then placed in each chamber, and
the balls, without wadding or patch, are put one at a time upon the
mouths of the chambers, turned under the rammer and forced down,
by the lever, below the mouth of the chamber. This is repeated
until all the chambers are loaded. Percussion caps are then placed
on the nipples, when, by drawing back the hammer to the full
catch, the click or lever is brought into contact with one of the
ratchet teeth, on the base of the cylinder, bringing the nipple into
the precise position to receive the blow of the hammer: the arm is
then in a condition for being discharged by simply pulling the
trigger; and a repetition of the same portion produces the like
results, until all the chambers are discharged through the barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;The movements of the revolving chamber and hammer are
admirably provided for. The breach, containing six cylindrical
cells for holding the powder and ball, moves one-sixth of a revolution
at a time; it can, therefore, only be fired when the chamber
and the barrel are in a direct line. The base of the cylindrical breech
being cut externally into a circular ratchet of six teeth (the lever
which moves the ratchet being attached to the hammer), as the
hammer is raised in the act of cocking, the cylinder is made to
revolve, and to revolve in one direction only. While the hammer
is falling, the chamber is firmly held in its position by a lever fitted
for the purpose; when the hammer is raised, the lever is removed
and the chamber released.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as the hammer remains at half-cock the chamber is
free, and can be loaded at pleasure. The rapidity with which these
arms can be loaded is one of their great recommendations, the
powder being merely poured into each receptacle in succession, and
the balls being then dropped in upon it, without any wadding, and
driven home by the ramrod, which of course is never required to
enter the barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;While carried in the pocket, or belt, there is no possibility of
an accidental discharge of these pistols. Whenever it is required
to clean the barrel and chamber, they can be taken to pieces in a
moment, wiped out, oiled, and replaced.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hammer at full-cock forms the sight by which aim is<span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
taken. The pistol is readily cocked by the thumb of the right
hand, a plan in every way far superior to the arrangement whereby
the hammer is raised by a pull on the trigger: this is in every
respect most objectionable, the pull materially interfering with the
correctness of aim; and the sear-spring having the duty of the
main-spring to perform as well, is apt constantly to be getting out
of order.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ramrod attached to these pistols consists of a very clever but
simple compound lever, which, forcing the ball effectually home,
hermetically seals the chamber containing the powder, and by the
application of a small quantity of wax to the nipple before capping,
the pistol may be immersed for hours in water without the chance
of a miss-fire.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The great disadvantage said to be existing in this
revolver is the necessity of cocking and half-cocking
at every discharge; which double action is difficult
in certain positions where revolvers are of the greatest
use, as in a mel&eacute;e surrounded by many enemies,
where the cocking and firing by one pulling motion,
as in Tranter&#8217;s and Dean&#8217;s, is more expeditious: in
fact, certificates are published by officers who, at the
battle of Inkermann, would have been cut down had
the slightest delay been necessary for cocking the
pistol. On the other hand, it is said, that no certain
aim can be taken where the pulling up and sudden
liberation of the mainspring discharges the pistol;
the act of discharging it destroying the aim. These
two points have their advocates and their objectors,
as has always been the case with new plans.</p>

<p>The mechanical construction of Colt&#8217;s pistol is
effected entirely by machinery, and on this account
superiority is claimed for it; in my opinion, however,
the boasted benefits of machinery have never yet
been realised. The manufacture of guns without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
machinery is difficult, but the entire use of it is
unnecessary. Certain portions of pistol-making can
never be done as they should be by machinery; and
I have not yet been able to discover anything in
Colt&#8217;s manufacture to make me advocate the use of
machinery. I should not consider a pistol made by
hand, and equal to the best of Colt&#8217;s, as well made;
a hand-made pistol ought to be much better in all
respects.</p>

<p>Dean and Adams were the first makers of note
who contested the palm with Colt. They thus
describe their pistol:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The barrel, the lock-frame, and top-bar were all forged out of
one piece of iron: the chamber to contain five charges, revolved on
a centre pin, which could be either drawn entirely, or partially out,
as was required and was held in its position by a side spring; the
toothed ratchet was secured to the base of the chamber by two
screws, so as to admit of its being renewed, when it was abraded by
use, and motion was given to it by a ratchet pall, connected with
the hammer, which was lifted by pulling the trigger. The hammer
moved on a transverse pin, and was pressed down on the nipple by
a back spring in the stock, being connected with it by a swivel link;
the trigger was kept in position by a horizontal bent spring, and
had attached to it the hammer-lifter and the ratchet pall; the point
of the former fell into a notch in the base of the hammer, so that
as the trigger was pulled, the hammer was raised, until the rounded
portion of the base, acting as a cam, forced the lifter out of the
notch, and allowed the hammer to descend on the nipple and to
explode the percussion-cap. On withdrawing the finger from the
trigger, the lifter and ratchet pall descended and again slipped into
the notches of the hammer and the chamber, in readiness for
repeating the operation of firing. The lifter was retained in contact
with the hammer, by a small flat spring, the upper end of
which was attached to the pall, while the lower end acted upon the
lifter, which, in turning on its centre, brought the lower prolongation
against the spring, below the centre, so as to press the upper
end in the proper direction, in order that its action might be certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The rotation of the chambers was obtained by a ratchet pall,
acting on a tooth each time the trigger was pulled, thus causing
the chambers to revolve, so far as to bring a nipple into the proper
position for receiving the blow of the hammer, and in that situation
it was held by a projecting stop on the back of the trigger.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to load the chambers it was necessary that they should
revolve free of the stop: this was effected by pressing inwards
another stop, attached to a spring on the side of the lock, which
engaged the point of the hammer and prevented it from descending
on the nipple, until the chambers were loaded, when, on the trigger
being pulled, the side spring stop was released and resumed its
original position, leaving the weapon ready for action.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bullets were cast with a small &#8216;tang&#8217; on them, which served
to fix a wad on each; thus no ramrod was required in loading, the
bullets being merely pressed in with the finger. The aperture of
the barrel was slightly expanded at the lower end to admit of the
bullets entering more readily in firing. The rifling of the barrel
was the reverse of the ordinary system, as it consisted of three projecting
&#8216;feathers,&#8217; or ridges, extending the length of the tube,
leaving very wide grooves between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be observed, that the cocking and firing were performed
by the same action of the trigger; therefore the rapidity of firing
was proportionally great; the arm was very light, its construction
simple, and its action certain.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The defect of cocking and firing by the same action
of the trigger must have been important; for new
patents were, I believe, taken to cover both plans,
and they now manufacture what is termed a double-action
pistol, which acts either by cocking with the
finger, or by the trigger, as of old. The important
improvement in the durability and soundness of Dean
and Adams&#8217;s pistol over Colt&#8217;s is, that the barrel,
the lock-frame, and top bar, are all forged out of one
piece of iron; thus, the cylinders revolve in a frame
which cannot undergo any displacement.</p>

<p>In Colt&#8217;s, the barrel is supported by a crooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
elbow, rising from the centre, or revolving pin;
its principal support consequently is some distance
below the tube of the barrel, but parallel to it: the
effect of long firing is to bend this elbow, causing
the barrel to fall or droop downward, instead of continuing
in a straight line with the chambers; thus,
an opening between the chambers and the barrel is
established, increasing the space for lateral escape.</p>

<p>Next, though certainly not least, is Tranter&#8217;s pistol,
of three different modes of construction. The name
of this manufacturer has risen higher than that of
his London competitors; owing, no doubt, in a great
measure, to the generally entertained opinion that
all essential improvements in the English revolving
pistols have arisen from the skill and untiring
industry of Mr. William Tranter. Whether the
opinion that he originated all the improvements
claimed for Dean and Adams&#8217;s pistol is well founded
or not, I cannot say: I only reiterate the opinion;
and I believe, from the very great attention Mr.
Tranter has paid to the subject, and from his great
mechanical skill, that he is quite capable of effecting
these improvements. Any admirer of beautiful
arrangements in gunnery has only to examine one of
his double-trigger revolving pistols, to be struck with
the elaborate nature of his improvements. I give a
<a href="#Fig33">wood-cut</a> of it on the next page, and some quotations
from his own description of its quality:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;W. Tranter&#8217;s patents for a double trigger, a safety-hammer
spring, an elongated socket for the chamber,
a loading lever, and a lubricating bullet for revolving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
arms, increase the value and efficiency of these arms
as defensive weapons.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig33" id="Fig33"></a>
<img src="images/illo446.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="273" />
<p class="caption">Half size of the medium 54 gauge double-trigger
Revolver.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;By means of the patent double-trigger
the pistol can be held more
firmly in the hand while being
fired, and only one hand is required
to raise the hammer and fire the
pistol. A perfectly accurate and
quicker aim can be taken, and
the pistol discharged at the instant
desired; the hammer can
be raised again without lowering
or removing the pistol from the
object till the whole of the chambers
are fired off. The chamber
is held firmly opposite the front
barrel before the
hammer begins to
fall, and also at
the moment it is
discharged; the
chamber cannot
be turned away
from the front
barrel by the
hammer at the
moment it is discharged.
In cases
of emergency the
pistol can be fired
with the greatest rapidity by pulling both triggers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
together. The exploded caps do not get into the
works and render the pistol useless till removed.
But little practice is required to enable a person to
shoot with accuracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The patent safety hammer spring always acts with
the hammer and trigger; should anything accidentally
lift the hammer, the safety-spring instantly falls
under it and prevents it falling upon the cap, thereby
preventing an accidental discharge. The safety-spring
also facilitates the loading, by allowing the
hammer to rest upon it while the chambers are being
charged, and at the same time acting as a safety-spring
during the operation of loading. The pistol
can be carried with perfect safety when loaded, either
in the pocket or holster, by allowing the hammer to
rest upon the safety-spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;By means of the patent elongating socket, the
chamber can be properly and readily adjusted to the
frame of the pistol; and as the chamber with use
becomes too free, and the strength of the shooting
depreciated, the elongating socket enables it to be
readjusted as perfectly as when first made&mdash;an
important consideration with these arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;The patent loading lever enables the pistol to be
loaded with greater facility, and fits the lubricating
bullet to the chamber so exactly that the powder cannot
fail to bend up the flange of the bullet and distribute
the lubrication all over the inner surface of the chamber
and barrel; it also fixes the bullet so firmly in
its place in the chamber that it does not fall out
with being carried in the pocket or holster, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
does it project forward with the firing of the
pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;The patent lubricating bullet, with the lubricating
composition, effectually lubricates the inner surface
of the chamber as far as the bullet enters, also the
face of the chamber where it comes in contact with
the front barrel, and the whole of the inner surface
of the front barrel; thereby preventing any deposit
of lead or powder that may deform the bullet,
enabling the pistol to be loaded with the greatest
ease after firing a number of shots, and facilitating
the passage of the bullet through the front barrel.
The accurate fitting of the bullet and the repellent
properties of the lubrication completely protect the
powder from exposure to wet or damp, and effectually
prevent one chamber igniting the powder in the
other while being fired. The pistol has been fired
five hundred times in succession with the lubricating
bullets without being cleaned or getting out of order,
the last fifty shots being fired with as much accuracy
as the first; the pistol could then be loaded and
fired with the greatest facility, there being no deposit
which interfered either with the loading or firing.</p>

<p>&#8220;W. Tranter has taken out another patent for
improvements in fire-arms, and having combined
with those improvements some of the improvements
comprised in his former patents, recommends the
above as possessing every requisite for a double-action
cocking revolver.&#8221;</p>

<p>These revolvers will be found to possess the following
advantages:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The pistol can be used with one hand, and fired
with the greatest rapidity and
facility by pulling the trigger with
the fore finger only.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hammer can be raised
and the pistol fired as an ordinary
fowling-piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;The spring lock for locking
the chambers enables the pistol
to be carried safely, and can be
released when required by the
thumb of the right hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lock of the pistol is simple,
and not liable to derangement.
It can be easily taken to pieces
when required,
and as easily put
together again.</p>

<p>&#8220;The patent
elongating socket
is combined with
this revolver in
the same manner
as with the patent
double-trigger revolver,
and with
the same advantages.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig34" id="Fig34"></a>

<p class="caption">Tranter&#8217;s double-action Revolver.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The new patent loading lever is attached to this
revolver in the same manner and with the same
advantages as to the patent double-trigger revolver.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>Webley&#8217;s patent revolving pistol is an improvement
upon Colt&#8217;s best pistol, the cylinder rotating by the
cocking of the lock. The advantages obtained are,
an exceedingly simple construction in the rotating
movement, enabling the patentee to manufacture
them at a lower price than any of the preceding
makers, and thus to produce, what is a great desideratum,
a good and reasonable priced pistol.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig35" id="Fig35"></a>
<img src="images/illo450.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="262" />
<p class="caption">Webley&#8217;s Revolver.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Keep your powder dry&#8221; was the old watchword:
&#8220;Take care of your ammunition&#8221; ought to be the
watchword of the present day.</p>

<p>Facility of loading is no doubt to a certain extent
an advantage, but doubts exist whether breech-loading
guns, if brought to such a state of perfection
as to come into general use, would not, from their
very facility of loading, become a serious evil.</p>

<p>The difficulty which Commanding Officers have
to contend with in war is in restraining their men
from firing too rapidly, using two shots where one
would suffice; but the process of loading inculcates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
care of it, takes considerable trouble, and hence men
husband their fire the more.</p>

<p>The two different principles of revolvers illustrate
this. The self-acting one is apt to be fired more
than once; a man in a state of excitement may pull
twice before he pauses, and two shots are expended
where one would have sufficed. The cocking-lock
pistol, in addition to the less pull required in firing,
gives time for observation, as the necessity for cocking
every time creates a pause, and is an admonition
to coolness: this is often very advantageous in
shooting game, in which, as in the more serious
affair of shooting men, deliberate coolness is required.</p>

<p>Therefore, excepting only the chance&mdash;the very
remote chance, that may arise, requiring you to fire
six shots as rapidly as possible&mdash;so rapidly that the
cocking pistol would be too slow, I would myself
prefer the cocking pistol; from the fact of being
able to take much better aim with it, and there
being less chance of missing, through the heavy pull
necessary to raise the cock and fire the pistol on the
self-acting principle. The almost general adoption,
in the present day, of the cocking-lock, and its application
in both Adams&#8217;s and Tranter&#8217;s self-acting
principles, is proof of the general bias towards the
same opinion.</p>

<p>The tendency of all revolving pistols, and of course
revolving rifles also, to foul in the barrel after a few
shots, is a very serious drawback to their efficiency
in use. The following quotation from Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Symons&#8217; work is one opinion which I select from a
number in my possession:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Revolving pistols only ought now-a-days, in my
opinion, to be made breech-loading; and of these
the pistol of Colonel Colt is a very good specimen.
I can generally hit a target the size of a man with
this pistol at a distance of 150 yards when clean,
<i>i. e.</i>, with the first shot; and I on one occasion put
five out of the six shots into the target successively.
When foul, however, the bullets will not fly steadily
and on their points. I one day, for the purpose of
experiment, fired 60 rounds without cleaning, at
planks placed a few yards off only, when latterly the
bullets, instead of cutting the circular holes they had
been doing, commenced to make marks in the planks
as if nails an inch long had struck them sideways.
On taking off the barrel to ascertain the cause, I
found that it was nearly choked up with lead. The
barrel of this pistol rapidly fouls, though the chambers
do not.&#8221;</p>

<p>It also furnishes a complete answer to the absurd
proposition of imparting spiral motion to a bullet, by
means of an increasing spiral, after it is put into high
velocity. The fouling of the barrel by lead to an
extent (as I have seen) of a considerable portion of
the bore, is absolute proof that the bullet does not
follow the course of the grooving: in its passage
through the directing barrel it passes straight out,
with the velocity imparted to it in the chamber.</p>

<p>The experience of this fact induced Mr. Tranter
to invent his lubricating bullet, the only form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
pistol with which many shots can be fired without
cleaning. There are, in reality, many defects to be
overcome (though it is very doubtful whether they
will ever be) before revolvers can in any degree be
relied upon for constant operations. I know for a
fact that at this moment Government have in store
many thousands, disabled for all useful purposes,
though by the most trivial circumstances; fouling
with lead being one of the most prominent defects,
or some trifling disarrangement of the rotating
machinery, such as it might be supposed could be
repaired: but they are returned to store as hopeless,
in the usual course, and thus their fate is sealed
as a military weapon.</p>

<p>The double-barrelled under-and-over pistol was
entirely discarded for the new toy; but hopes are
entertained that the former will soon be restored to
the lost preference of all who value their own safety,
and would rather depend on two certainly destructive
shots than six uncertain ones. For my own personal
use in any scene of combat, my reliance
would be on a pair of double-barrelled pistols; or
what is of more use still, on double carbines. The
Emperor of the French, however, is arming his
sailors with revolving pistols; and lately, in India,
a squadron of Dragoons used the revolver with deadly
effect on a body of rebel Sepoys.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="chapname">ENFIELD MACHINE-MADE RIFLES.</span></h2>

<p>Enfield, the seat of the Government manufacture of
small arms, will become a celebrated place in future
history; its productions being now one of the wonders
of the present age. The term &#8220;Enfield Rifle&#8221; does
not denote any one improvement, but a series of
improvements; Enfield being merely the name of the
place where the manufactory is situated.</p>

<p>The Enfield rifle differs from the original rifled
musket (better known as the Mini&eacute; musket) in the
fact of the bore having been reduced to &middot;577, and the
weight of the arm to 9 lbs. The regulation Mini&eacute;
musket was 10 lbs. 8<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> oz. in weight, so that a saving
of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lbs. has been effected by the adoption of the present
gun. The size of the bore was &middot;702, and the
weight of the bullet 680 grains, whilst the present
regulation musket is only &middot;577 bore, the bullet being
520 grains in weight.</p>

<p>The model arms ordered by Lord Hardinge, the
Commander-in-Chief, in 1852, of Messrs. Greener,
Purday, Richards, Lancaster, and Wilkinson, formed
the base from which the Enfield was constructed.
The &#8220;Sight&#8221; was Westley Richards&#8217; invention. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Expanding Bands for securing the stock and barrels
(without which a machine-made musket would
always be an uncertainty) are an invention of mine;
several other points were also adopted on my recommendation:
as, for instance, the furniture being case-hardened,
as in the rifle-corps gun, and the fastenings
of the bayonet. These points, however, being merely
suggested improvements, and not, strictly speaking,
inventions, conferred no benefit on me beyond the
compliment involved in their adoption.</p>

<p>It is well known that, but for my evidence before a
committee of the House of Commons in 1848, the
swivel-lock would not have been so soon adopted as it
was. Thus it is evident that much of the outer form,
as well as the principle, of the present arm is due
to my exertions. Much surprise was shown by the
Select Committee in 1852 that I did not give in
for trial some improvement upon my own principle
(which, by the by, they had not at that time admitted);
but prudence taught me otherwise: to have
done so would have affected the soundness of my
claims.</p>

<p>About the year 1851 it was determined to adopt
some portion of the American system of manufacturing
guns by the aid of machinery. A commission
was appointed and sent out to the United States in
order to inspect the operations of their mechanism,
and to ascertain the advisability of adopting the
whole, or a portion, of their machinery in England.
To the selection of the members of that commission,
and to their judgment, may be ascribed whatever is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
ill or good in the system; the majority being military
men connected with military matters, and the others
machinists, the bias was no doubt in favour of
machinery. The Enfield manufactory, at its starting,
was intended to be a moderate affair, I believe; but
now it has expanded into such gigantic proportions
that, if it continues in action, the manufacture of
military arms must partially cease to be the trade
of Birmingham: for all large establishments of
machinery must be employed, to protect them from
decay; and whatever may be the cost of production,
machinery must go on, or be entirely given up.</p>

<p>The extent of the Enfield manufactory may be
estimated from the fact that it now produces weekly
1,100 stand of arms complete, and employs men and
boys to the number of 1,300. At this rate of production,
a very few years will suffice to place such
a stock of arms at the command of the Government
as will render the employment of foreign artisans
unnecessary. Enfield machine-made arms are undoubtedly
specimens of the highest class of that
description; but whether they will be found as durable
as hand-made arms I very much doubt: time
alone can decide this.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="chapname">THE HARPOON GUN.</span></h2>

<p>Whale shooting has now become a great fact; no
other means being used to capture this monster of
the deep but the harpoon gun, when it is possible to
obtain it. Although little doubt remains but that
whales, like &#8220;grouse,&#8221; are becoming scarce, and that
in a short time they will become almost extinct, yet
their great value when captured will always stimulate
hardy and daring seamen to pursue them even into
their remotest haunts. The following <a href="#Fig36">cut</a> represents
the boat and gun now in use.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig36" id="Fig36"></a>
<img src="images/illo457.jpg" alt="Harpoon gun" width="550" height="274" />
</div>

<p>Experience has proved the value of this invention;
and every ship that goes to the fishing has now a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
full complement of six harpoon guns. Nine-tenths of
the fish got within the last few years have been shot.
From a calculation I made after the conclusion of a
late season, the result must have been very satisfactory
and profitable to the owners of the ships, and also to
the gun-makers. I have every reason to know that
the amount of money realised by these harpoon guns
amounted to little short of 100,000<abbr title="pound">l.</abbr>; and this from
guns of my manufacture alone: for I, like most
inventors, have competitors, who manufacture upon
my model and at less than my price.</p>

<p>Harpoon guns are similar to small swivel guns;
they are of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch bore and 3 feet long in the barrel,
which when stocked and complete weighs 75 lbs. The
construction of the lock is very simple, being upon
the principle of a saddle pistol lock; the caps, the
nipples, and lock, are completely and effectually
covered, and protected from damp, or spray from
the sea. The lock is also securely bolted until the
moment it is wanted; when by the removal of a pin,
the trigger string is pulled, which fires the gun. The
harpoon is projected with considerable accuracy to
any distance under eighty-four yards; that being the
greatest range ever obtained with this description of
gun. The charge is very small to project 40 lbs.
weight; for the harpoon itself is 10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lbs., with an
increasing weight of three-inch line from the gun to
the extreme range, in all weighing full 40 lbs. This
immense improvement is the result of calculations,
deduced from the nature of gunpowder. The charge
is short of an ounce of powder; but is, or ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
to be, good powder, of the largest grain; fine powder
will not do it, but, on the contrary, would jump up
the end of the harpoon, or bend it, so that it would
be of no further use until repaired.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="chapname">ON SHOT, CAPS, AND WADDING.</span></h2>

<p>Patent shot being still produced as at the time of
publishing previous editions of my works, I have no
important improvement to record.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig37" id="Fig37"></a>
<img src="images/illo460.jpg" alt="Shot tower" width="350" height="420" />
</div>

<p>The manufacture is very simple: the lead is first
tempered by the aid of arsenic, in the proportions
required by the slag (a technical term) for the kind
used; some lead taking more and some less. The
melted metal is then poured into a perforated pan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
placed over the mouth of the pit, or tower (whichever
may be in use.) Messrs. Walkers, Parkers,
and Co. have towers in their various factories where
they make shot; the <a href="#Fig37">cut</a> represents the one in Newcastle.
Messrs. Locke, Blackett, and Co. cast down
the shaft of a pit, and by this means obtain a greater
fall. The fluid metal takes a globular shape in
falling, and the concentric motion of each particle
round its axis keeps it in this form until its passage
through the air has extracted the heat, and before
it reaches the body of water placed to receive it.
The only difficulty is in casting very large sizes; for
if the distance the drops fall be not sufficiently great,
and they reach the water in a semi-fluid state, the
resistance of the water misshapes them. About three
different sizes come out through one pan. These are
separated by the aid of riddles, or tabled, as the
process is termed. A quantity of the shot is placed
on a slight incline, when those that do not run off are
rejected. The whole are then polished in a machine
termed a drum, with a mixture of black lead. This
gives to the shot that beautiful polish which captivates
the eye, but which injures the shooting of the
gun, as the black lead adheres to the interior of the
tube. All shot should be used unpolished; and the
addition of hardness is unquestionably another advantage.
Slag-lead is lighter than other lead, but it is
much harder, and thus more suitable for shot. I
regret the disuse of shot made with quicksilver, as it
is unquestionably much superior, though more costly.
A considerable improvement is yet to be introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
in the manipulation of shot-making; and I
shall commence a round of experiments with that
object at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Copper caps are now a misnomer: very few are to
be met with. Brass caps boiled to the colour of
copper are the rule, the former the exception. Good
caps are made in Birmingham, if a remunerative price
is paid for them; and I have the pleasure to name
several makers: Messrs. E. and A. Ludlow, Messrs.
Pursall and Philips, and Mr. Cox. It must be borne
in mind that cheapness means inferiority: every
article is made according to price.</p>

<p>Is the best mixture where the corrosive principle is
not heeded.</p>

<p>Messrs. Eley, Brothers, were the first manufacturers
who turned their attention to making waterproof
copper caps for sporting purposes, commencing it in
1837. The principle is simple, the excellence mainly
consisting in the quality of the ingredients used, and
their being thoroughly secured from the effects of
moisture. They are so constituted that the largest
portion of the percussion powder and the weakest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
part of the waterproof covering which lines the inner
surface of the cap, are immediately over the surface
of the nipple; consequently, when the blow ignites
the percussion powder, the larger portion of the
explosion is forced down the nipple, and is of such
intensity of heat (especially in platina-lined nipples)
that it will ignite the gunpowder some distance up
the barrel: in an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eprouvette</i> it will do so at four or
five inches from the nipple. A miss-fire thus very
seldom occurs, as the heat is sure to penetrate to the
charge, even when a gun has become foul after a long
day&#8217;s shooting and the powder cannot pass freely
through the chambers to the nipples. It is well
known that caps which do not possess these igniting
qualities may be fired through gunpowder, and frequently
fail to ignite it, from the want of proper
attention to the constitution of the fulminate and its
mixture. In all cheaply manufactured caps this
inferiority is sure to prevail, and the manifold advantages
to be derived from the sterling quality of all
sporting adjuncts is now fully appreciated by sportsmen
generally. &#8220;Penny wise and pound foolish&#8221; is a
proverb more borne in mind than formerly, and the
conviction is now general that a good gun only proves
to be so when proper attention is paid to the loading
in every particular.</p>

<p>Good wadding is as essential as good gunpowder:
a perfect separation must be maintained between the
exploded powder and the shot, or no result can be
depended upon; cheap wadding, therefore, according
to the above adage, is out of favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>Cartridges of wire, or &#8220;universal,&#8221; are now so well
known as to need no treatise to point out their advantages.
A more striking example of the progress of
knowledge in properly estimating the value of high-class
manufactures cannot be adduced than in the
case of Eley, Brothers, who have by unwearied industry
in the production of sporting ammunition of
the first quality, nearly obtained a monopoly in that
department of gunnery.</p>

<p>I can safely refer to the Manufacturers to be found
in the <a href="#Adverts">advertising list</a> as able to supply the sportsman
with all requisites, from a gun &#8220;to a turnscrew,&#8221; and
on such terms as will be found to be advantageous to
the purchaser.</p>

<i>GUN MANUFACTURER</i>,<br />
ASTON NEW TOWN, BIRMINGHAM,<br />
<span class="smcapall">HIGHEST PRIZE MEDALLIST IN 1851, 1853, and 1855</span>,</p>

<p>In returning thanks to the Sporting World for their distinguished
support during many years, begs to intimate to them
that he has now accomplished the long cherished wish of
establishing his manufactory in Birmingham, the seat of the
gun manufacture, where the facilities of producing a first-rate
gun are superior to any other locality in the world; for here
he can reject imperfect materials and replace them, while
makers in other parts of the kingdom would be writing about
the deficiency. Here he can exercise his own judgment on
the goodness of material during the progress of production;
here he can carry out any alteration or improvement in barrels
or locks that may suggest itself; and here eventually
will settle the whole manufacture for the kingdom. This is
nearly accomplished now, for it would be idle to conceal the
fact that a vast majority of what is sold in London, as London
make, is made here. Here the best workmen are congregating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A2" id="Page_A2">[2]</a></span>
and meet with the greatest encouragement. Under
these circumstances he has judged it best to avail himself of
the means offered of producing, without &#8220;egotism,&#8221; guns
equal, if not superior, to anything yet produced by any maker
whatever. This may be considered a wide assertion, but to
prove he does not make it rashly he is prepared to test the
fact by a competition with any maker whatever, barring
none; to be decided by the following five points: 1st, safety&mdash;the
greatest difficulty in bursting; 2ndly, lightness; 3rdly,
goodness of shooting&mdash;strength and closeness combined with
the least charges; 4thly, durability; 5thly, beauty and taste
combined.</p>

<p>He considers it a crime of great magnitude that guns should
burst; they never do so where proper metal is used. He will
produce an ordinary weight of barrel which he will allow any
one to burst if they can; in fact, he believes it to be the greatest
difficulty to do so.</p>

<p>W. G. will undertake contracts for quantities of arms subject
to private arrangement, such as military arms, shipping
ditto, rifles or sealing guns, for foreign powers or private companies,
provided in all cases the quality be sufficiently good
to enable him to brand them with his name; anything inferior
he declines to make.</p>

<div class="fsize90">

<p>ELEY BROTHERS, <span class="smcap">London</span>, beg to call the attention of
Sportsmen to the advantages to be derived from the use of
the Wire Cartridge, in the pursuit of all kinds of large or
small game.</p>

<p>As there are few Sportsmen who are not in the habit of
using these Cartridges, they are so well known as to make a
description of them scarcely requisite. The shot is packed
within a wire cage, which is constructed so as to allow them
to escape from it gradually while the charge is in motion.
They cause all guns to shoot with double the strength which
can be obtained by the ordinary mode of loading, and with
much greater regularity, as each shot retains its spherical
form.</p>

<p>The Royal Cartridge is mostly used in this country for
killing wild game.</p>

<p>The Green Cartridge is the sort generally in demand for
India and America, being made for foreign field sports with
the largest drop shot, and also with mould shot, and will be
found very effective at large game where the Sportsman has
not a rifle in the field.</p>

<p class="center highline20"><span class="fsize125 gesp">ELEY&#8217;S</span><br />
DOUBLE WATERPROOF CENTRAL FIRE CAPS.</p>

<div class="fsize90">

<p>These Caps are now well known and approved, being
found superior to all others for their certainty and rapidity of
fire, either in dry or wet weather.</p>

<p>For India and the Colonies, or any climate where Caps
may be exposed to great vicissitudes of heat, cold, or
moisture, they are particularly recommended, as they cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A15" id="Page_A15">[15]</a></span>
be injured by any amount of exposure to wet or heat, nor
their qualities impaired, if kept for years in a tropical
climate. The ignition at all times is safe and certain, whilst
in humid weather, the discharge is as instantaneous as with
the ordinary Cap on the dryest day.</p>

<p>For testimonials as to their value for shooting in India <i>see</i>
Colonel Jacob&#8217;s work on &#8220;Rifles and Projectiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>They have been much approved for the rifle in foreign
field sports, where the Cap is often allowed to remain a long
time upon the nipple.</p>

<p>Being perfectly waterproof, they will bear immersion in
sea-water for days without injury; but when testing them in
this manner, it is necessary to blow the water out of them
before placing them upon the nipple.</p>

<p>Concaved Felt, and chemically prepared Cloth Gun Waddings,
to prevent the leading of guns, warranted not to blow
to pieces in the barrel.</p>

<p>Cartridges for Breech-loading Shot Guns, Rifles, &amp;c.; also
for Sharp&#8217;s Breech-loading Rifles, and Prince&#8217;s Breech-loading
Carbines.</p>

<p>Cartridges made for Needle Rifles, very simple and
effective in their construction.</p>

<p>Skin Cartridges, suitable for Adams&#8217;, Deane&#8217;s, and Colt&#8217;s
Revolvers&mdash;warranted to leave no deposit when fired.</p>

<p class="book"><i>Notes on the Pictures in the Exhibition of
the Royal Academy, &amp;c., for 1858</i> <span class="fsize80">By <span class="smcap">John Ruskin</span>.</span></p>

<p class="bookdetails"><i>Fifth Thousand. 8vo, price One Shilling.</i></p>

<p class="book"><i>The Political Economy of Art.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80 up2 right"><i>Price 2s. 6d. cloth.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;A most able, eloquent, and well-timed
work. We hail it with satisfaction, thinking
it calculated to do much practical good, and
we cordially recommend it to our readers.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Witness.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">Mr. Ruskin&#8217;s chief purpose is to treat the
artist&#8217;s power, and the art itself, as items of
the world&#8217;s wealth, and to show how these
may be best evolved, produced, accumulated,
and distributed.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;We never quit Mr. Ruskin without being
the better for what he has told us, and we
therefore recommend this little volume, like all
his other works, to the perusal of our readers.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Economist.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;This book, daring, as it is, glances keenly
at principles, of which some are among the
articles of ancient codes, while others are
evolving slowly to the light.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Leader.</i></p>

<p class="bookdetails"><i>Second Edition. Crown 8vo. With Illustrations drawn by the Author.</i><br />
<i>Price 7s. 6d., cloth.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;The rules are clearly and fully laid down;
and the earlier exercises always conducive to
the end by simple and unembarrassing means.
The whole volume is full of liveliness.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;We close this book with a feeling that,
though nothing supersedes a master, yet that
no student of art should launch forth without
this work as a compass.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Athen&aelig;um.</cite></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;It will be found not only an invaluable
acquisition to the student, but agreeable and
instructive reading for any one who wishes to
refine his perceptions of natural scenery, and
of its worthiest artistic representations.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Economist.</cite></p>

to be at once instructive and suggestive.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Literary

the subject which has ever come under our

Beauty.</i></p>

<p class="bookdetails"><i>Imperial 8vo, with Thirty-five Illustrations engraved on Steel, and
116 Woodcuts, drawn by the Author. Price 2l. 10s. cloth.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;Considered as an illustrated volume, this
is the most remarkable which Mr. Ruskin
has yet issued. The plates and woodcuts are
profuse, and include numerous drawings of
mountain form by the author, which prove
Mr. Ruskin to be essentially an artist. He is
an unique man, both among artists and
writers.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;The present volume of Mr. Ruskin&#8217;s
elaborate work treats chiefly of mountain
scenery, and discusses at length the principles
involved in the pleasure we derive from
mountains and their pictorial representation.
The singular beauty of his style, the hearty
sympathy with all forms of natural loveliness,
the profusion of his illustrations form irresistible
attractions.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p class="bookdetails"><i>With Eighteen Illustrations drawn by the Author, and engraved on Steel.</i></p>

<p class="bookdetails"><i>Price 38s. cloth.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;Every one who cares about nature, or
poetry, or the story of human development&mdash;every
one who has a tinge of literature or
philosophy, will find something that is for him
in this volume.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Westminster Review.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;Mr. Ruskin is in possession of a clear and
penetrating mind; he is undeniably practical
in his fundamental ideas; full of the deepest
reverence for all that appears to him beautiful
and holy. His style is, as usual, clear, bold,
racy. Mr. Ruskin is one of the first writers of
the day.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Economist.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;The present volume, viewed as a literary
achievement, is the highest and most striking
evidence of the author&#8217;s abilities that
has yet been published.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Leader.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;All, it is to be hoped, will read the book
for themselves. They will find it well worth
a careful perusal.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;This book is one which, perhaps, no other
man could have written, and one for which
the world ought to be and will be thankful. It
is in the highest degree eloquent, acute, stimulating
to thought, and fertile in suggestion.
It will, we are convinced, elevate taste and
intellect, raise the tone of moral feeling,
kindle benevolence towards men, and increase
the love and fear of God.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Times.</cite></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;The &#8216;Stones of Venice&#8217; is the production
of an earnest, religious, progressive, and informed
mind. The author of this essay on
architecture has condensed into it a poetic apprehension,
the fruit of awe of God, and
delight in nature; a knowledge, love, and
just estimate of art; a holding fast to fact and
repudiation of hearsay; an historic breadth,
and a fearless challenge of existing social problems,
whose union we know not where to find
paralleled.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;By the &#8216;Seven Lamps of Architecture,&#8217;
we understand Mr. Ruskin to mean the seven
fundamental and cardinal laws, the observance
of and obedience to which are indispensable
to the architect, who would deserve the name.
The politician, the moralist, the divine, will
find in it ample store of instructive matter, as
well as the artist. The author of this work
belongs to a class of thinkers of whom we have
too few amongst us.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Examiner.</cite></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;Mr. Ruskin&#8217;s book bears so unmistakeably
the marks of keen and accurate observation,
of a true and subtle judgment and refined
sense of beauty, joined with so much earnestness,
so noble a sense of the purposes and
business of art, and such a command of rich
and glowing language, that it cannot but tell
powerfully in producing a more religious
view of the uses of architecture, and a deeper
insight into its artistic principles.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;Mr. Ruskin&#8217;s lectures&mdash;eloquent, graphic,
